Rather than bicker over raising taxes on some people and lowering taxes on other people we should cut everyone's taxes. 
Republicans promised to repeal all of Obamacare root and branch they promised to repeal not block grant. Tonight I present another chance. 
What I'm asking us to do is be responsible budget for this actually act like we really believe in what we say that the debt is a problem. 
It's budget vote-o-rama night. This amendment would allow instructions so we will do what we say we are going to do which is cut spending.

Rand Paul's Maneuver Against Endless Wars 
I will continue to fight and if necessary object to continue this debate  secure a vote and force Congress to do its duty.
Senate leaders have agreed not to try to end debate early and have agreed to four hours of debate under my control to debate these wars.
The Senate attempted to shorten debate &amp; move forward without consideration &amp; debate on my amendment to end our AUMF in Afghanistan and Iraq
Where is the anti-war left demanding the wars end? Where is the constitional conservative right demanding Congress reclaim its war powers?
I sit nearly alone but that's fine. I'll fight by myself if need be. This is too important 
Hypocrites they pretend concern over our constitutional duty to declare war and then block any vote on ending any of our 7 current wars
I sit for our soldiers young and brave. Sent to fight in distant lands in our forgotten forever war
I will continue this protest and these objections for as long as needed to ensure Congress do its duty and vote on ending these wars.
The Senate is now in a quorum call unable to act because of my protest. This is why I sit on the floor in silent protest.
We have been there for 16 years. It is time for them to end. It is time for Congress to vote on whether or not they should end.
Tonight I sit silently to protest the thousands of American soldiers who have died over the past decade in these wars.
An attempt was made to run the clock on the bill overnight. I objected and am now sitting on the floor of the Senate to stop that
I will object to all procedural motions and amendments unless and until my amendment is made in order and we vote on these wars
Tonight the Senate is attempting to move forward with the Defense Bill. I am seeking an amendment to end the AUMF in Afghanistan and Iraq.

@rareliberty: .@RandPaul: The failure to repeal Obamacare means premiums will continue to skyrocket 
The Senate fell one vote short tonight which is disappointing. I intend to keep fighting for repeal.
This week I voted multiple times to repeal Obamacare including offering my own clean repeal bill.
5. Expand HSA (larger maximum contributions)6.  Push and fund expansion of 1332 waivers for states to opt out of many regulations
3. Repeal 3 years of medical device tax 4.  Defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year
The next healthcare vote will be soon. The bill will: 1. Repeal Individual Mandate tax/penalty2. Repeal the job killing Employer mandate
"Just voted YES on the Heller Amdt. to permanently repeal the burdensome ""Cadillac"" tax on health insurance plans"
830 vote is to repeal the Cadillac tax an Obamacare tax that increases costs of insurance &amp; costs job creators and workers billions.

Today we took the first steps to repeal Obamacare. Here's my statement after today's #healthcare vote. 
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump If this is indeed the plan I will vote to proceed and I will vote for any all measures that are clean repeal.
@SenateMajLdr Repealing mandates &amp; taxes without new spending and bailouts. This is the path I've been urging and what I discussed with @realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr If we cannot pass full clean 2015 repeal I've also been told we will vote on whatever version of CLEAN repeal we can pass.
@SenateMajLdr I've been told by leadership their bill would now need 60 votes to pass votes they do not have. Therefore I believe it will fail.
@SenateMajLdr If that is the plan I will vote to proceed to have this vote. I also now believe we will be able to defeat the new spending and bailouts.
This morning @SenateMajLdr informed me that the plan for today is to take up the 2015 clean repeal bill as I've urged.
Joining @FoxNews now to talk healthcare 
I hope my colleagues will join me in this dual path – clean repeal and oppose the bailouts

@SenToddYoung: My decision should come as a surprise to no one. 
I don't think we should sell arms to Saudi Arabia if it might wind up in the hands of ISIS and if they punish people for protests... 
Today we will discuss an arms sale to Saudi Arabia that threatens the lives of millions of Yemenis... 
A year ago the Senate voted to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia. Now we are going to sell them weapons? What are we thinking?
There is an abundance of evidence that high level Saudis were complicit in 9/11. The 28 pages show that. Why would we give them arms?
Today we discuss issues of war and peace. 
We should be attempting to end the aquisition of ballistic missiles from both Iran and Saudi Arabia not fueling an arms race.
Even @HillaryClinton when she is speaking honestly in emails noted the Saudis have supported terrorism. Why would we give them anything?
And we are going to give them weapons? I say no.
We must stand up and tell Saudi Arabia ENOUGH. They are the biggest exporter of extremism and hatred in the world.
We can't fix every problem in the world. But today we can vote to not make one huge crisis worse.
17 million live in edge of starvation. Crisis may well be worse than Syria. And our country is going to further arm one side of this war
What can we do to help all those dying in Yemen? This is a huge humanitarian crisis. Children are dying from war and blockages by Saudis
They can't avoid the vote today. I forced it through a privileged motion. So let's talk about whether or not to arm Saudi Arabia
Today we will discuss issues of war &amp; peace which we rarely do. We have been in conflict over 15 years.
Saudi Arabia is causing a humanitarian crisis with a war in Yemen. It funds extremism worldwide. Abuses human rights. Stop arming them now.
The vote will be close.  It is time we stop the counterproductive and harmful practice of arming a country that promotes extremism
Heading to the floor to speak on my Resolution of Disapproval on selling arms to Saudi Arabia.

@justinamash: Thanks to @RandPaul for visiting with the @freedomcaucus to discuss the budget resolution and health care reform. 
With a President who supports #AuditTheFed in the White House Congress has no excuse to not quickly pass this bill. 
The more things change the more they seem to stay the same. 
@RepThomasMassie: Congress created the Federal Reserve so it is Congress’s responsibility to #AuditTheFed

@thereidfeed: .@RandPaul's #AiringofGrievances is one of my favorite holiday traditions #ChristmasEveEve
@TheGeneOkerlund: #HolyBalls I am waiting for the call. GO 
What's NOT a joke is wasteful spending &amp; the fact that I wish you all a Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays. Hope you enjoyed Festivus w/ me.
For the folks at @MSNBC that was a joke.
I'm gonna have to stop tweeting about Festivus soon @FoxNews just asked me to come on &amp; talk about my own personal #WaronChristmas. Rude.
But I'm upset VP &amp; cabinet wasn't picked w/ a reality show. I would have watched. You would have too don't deny it. #AiringofGrievances
My other colleagues @SenMikeLee &amp; @SenTedCruz are rumored to be on the Supreme court short list. @survivorcbs is gonna be so nerdy this year
On a positive note since that exchange @CoryBooker &amp; I have worked on many criminal justice bills proving Festivus brings us all together.
A few years ago I complained that my colleague @CoryBooker didn't retweet me enough. Apparently he can't take a hint. #AiringofGrievances
I was gonna pick Mitch but every time I tried to bring it up the Capitol Police kept getting twitchy. Sorry guys.
I decided I'd take on someone who thought he was a tough guy. Bring it @SenatorReid #featsofstrength 
If you only celebrate Festivus enjoy today and I hope you win the feats of strength later. I've been practicing...
I'll be celebrating Christmas with my family this weekend. We wish you a merry Christmas if you are too.
I'm grateful you've followed along with me today as in last years. I try to have fun sometimes. This town needs it.
Great now I'm proposing reality shows too. The new environment in DC is catching...#AiringofGrievances 
They follow as a bunch of old guys who didn't play ball in college attempt to not break themselves each year for charity #AiringofGrievances
Sticking with sports for a minute I have an idea for @HBO: hard knocks congressional baseball version.
Of course here in our own office my adviser @dougstafford thinks the @nyjets are real too. I can't convince him or Woody otherwise...
Also for those who think @WWE is real I'm very sorry Bernie Sanders lost.
I'm very sorry to have been the one to tell @jackhunter74 pro wrestling is not real in that last tweet.
Speaking of fake drama this administration is the first to include 2 @WWE hall of famers. My grievance is why isn't Mean Gene press sec?
"For those of you ""media"" writing serious stories about my Festivus jokes I don't even know what to say just stop...#AiringofGrievances "
We’ve got a lot of problems w/ how our tax dollars are spent &amp; you've only heard about some. But I'm not done yet... 
Those are just a few examples. Our hard-earned money is wasted everyday while our citizens vets &amp; infrastructure suffer #AiringofGrievances
The Department of State is advertising a $1.25 million grant opportunity to produce a superhero cartoon in Pakistan. #AiringofGrievances 
I bet you didn't know the federal government is using $30000 of your taxes to study Ugandan gambling practices. #AiringofGrievances 
The national Park Service announced a grant 2 study “Knowledge Experience and Beliefs of the Supernatural Environment.” #AiringofGrievances 
What do sea monsters a superhero cartoon in Pakistan &amp; gambling habits of Ugandans have in common? It's time for more #AiringofGrievances!
I've only just begun. I'll be back to talk waste more gov grievances and nonbinding resolutions against my Senate colleagues #HappyFestivus
New administration has some great people. But I wanna know who has to tell @realdonaldtrump he can't build a golf course on the South Lawn?
My favorite Cabinet pick is what's his name umm it's that guy who wanted to eliminate the Dept. of @ENERGY. Hang on I'll think of it...
I know I've said a lot about @AmbJohnBolton so you're probably expecting me 2 say something nice for the holidays. Nope. #AiringofGrievances
.@peterthiel is advising the President Elect. That's great. But his plan 2 make the Statue of Liberty into a digital stop sign is a bit much
New administration is lookin good. Haven't seen this many billionaires in 1 place since I staked out Bilderbergs w/ Alex Jones. Good times.
On the media &amp; #fakenews: Festivus is real media so don't try 2 fact check it. And @TheOnion is more accurate than a Brian Williams report
Hello again I hope everyone is having a Happy Festivus! It's once again time for my annual #AiringofGrievances...

Well #debatenight is over... I'm going to end on a happy note. 
Since we are talking about foreign policy here's my latest video about keeping taxpayer money for Kentucky and at home. #debatenight 
Clinton is most likely to take us to war. The next President should respect the Constitution.  #debatenight
I think we've reached the point in the debate where Hillary lists all the countries she would like to be at war with. #debatenight
.@Hillaryclinton Your husband passed all the laws that put a generation of black men in prison.  #debatenight
"""We have to work to repair all the damage I did to the criminal justice system in the 90s"" - what Hillary should say #debatenight"
Rules &amp; laws are apparently for other people not Clinton. It should preclude her from being president.  #debatenight
".@realDonaldTrump - ""The Fed is not doing its job"" I agree. We need to Audit the Fed!  #debatenight"
"Hillary wants us to go to her website to check her facts. THAT'S WHAT I AM HERE FOR HILLARY. I give her website ""Pants on Fire"" #debatenight"
"""When I was Sec of state we actually INCREASED exports..."" yes unfortunately it was arms to Jihadists #debatenight  "
"""Let's not assume trade is the only challenge in the economy."" No let's not. You &amp; all your big government regulations are YUGE challenges"
Q: Clinton how are you going to bring coal jobs back to Kentucky? A: Put them out of business. - Clintonthat's not how this works...
How can Hillary say she is for jobs when she has stated she will put Kentucky coal miners out of business? #debatenight 
Hillary just flubbed the one line she probably spent all week practicing. Nice zinger...#debatenight
wonder if Hillary is coming out w/ sponsorship badges like in NASCAR 1 for each of her 6 figure speeches &amp; #Clintoncash gifts #debatenight
Fact check #2. Hillary is lying right here. This is just a test. But this will happen soon. #debatenight
Fact check #1: Hillary's name is spelled with two Ls. Not a good start for her #debatenight. h/t @BennyJohnson 
Since @HillaryClinton and her friends all seemed so insistent to be fact checked on #debatenight I have agreed to do so. You're welcome.
I'm live tweeting #debatenight tonight. Don't miss it.

@rareliberty: .@RandPaul is right: The United States must stop arming Saudi Arabia 
It was great meeting students from Hickman County High School. Happy to see young people involved in government. 
I refuse to stand idly by while Kentuckians' hard earned tax dollars are spent overseas on countries who hate us and burn our flag. 
Today marks not the end of the battle but the beginning of a long Constitutional struggle... 
@TheNatlInterest: Why @RandPaul and @ChrisMurphyCT want to block a U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia:  
We must send a message right now today to Saudi Arabia: Stop putting Christians to death stop beheading protesters stop the abuse.
Or will the #ClintonCash secure the Saudis more favors and a blind eye to their terror financing and human rights abuses?
I can't be silent about Obama's Saudi arms deals. What will Hillary Clinton do? Will she stand up &amp; oppose selling weapons to Saudi Arabia?
Stop fueling a Middle East arms race and worsening an already horrific refugee crisis in Yemen.
Stop ignoring the cost of war and the innocent lives lost.
Stop arming countries who participate in financing terrorists and Islamic extremists around the world.
I'm standing up today to say no more. Stop. Stop arming nations that abuse their citizens and human rights.
Now Obama wants another $1.15 billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia because apparently his $100 billion in arms deals weren't enough.
Hillary Clinton looked the other way to the Saudi war on women and their terror financing because they bought her off.
Keep in mind this is also a country that recently bombed a hospital and school and consistently oppresses and violates the rights of women.
In fact Hillary Clinton's foundation has even taken $10-25 million from the Saudi regime and millions from a Saudi prince.
This was known to both president Obama and Hillary Clinton. But they continue to treat Saudi Arabia as a trusted ally.
Citizens and officials of one of our so called allies Saudi Arabia were involved in the financing of terror including 9/11.
I fought hard to have the 28 pages of the 9/11 report made public so Americans could know the truth.
By continuing to arm Saudi Arabia the Obama Administration ignores horrific human rights abuses and duplicitous actions by the Saudi regime.
A vote on selling arms to Saudi Arabia is a proxy vote on whether or not there should be unending war in the Middle East.
Today we didn't just debate Obama's $1.15 billion Saudi arms deal we debated constitutional principles and war.
@TomRoten: If you missed my conversation with @RandPaul listen here!

@rareliberty: Sen @RandPaul: Hillary Clinton Should Not Be Above the Law  via @TIMEIdeas
This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans’ faith in the justice system. 
I'm just gonna leave this right here. 
This is a loss for the rule of law and further degrades Americans' faith in the justice system.
Today Comey &amp; Obama's DOJ made it clear to the American people there's no accountability no justice &amp; the Clintons live by different rules.
The appearance is terrible. The decision is astounding. Ppl have gone to jail for less severe classified breaches and national security.
Three days later the FBI director announces no charges are being brought against Hillary Clinton.
This weekend we learned former President Clinton met with the Obama Administration Attorney general - the FBI director's boss - in private.
The FBI then announced she would face no charges. This is an outrage and the rule of law has been turned upside down.
Today the FBI announced @HillaryClinton violated classified procedures and recklessly endangered national security - over 100 times...
It's going down I'm yelling timber! Got to chop down a big tree on #IndependenceDay. Hope everyone had a good one. 
But mostly today I hope you'll celebrate our country which remains the greatest best and last hope for freedom. Fight for it every day.
Thanks to everyone who followed along today. I hope you'll read a few of my suggestions and crank up up a few of the songs.
"Closing out the 4th with a little known song an icon who was taken from us this year too soon: Prince ""America"" "
A beautifully written song about how freedom needs to be for everyone not just the powerful. Chimes of Freedom: 
From the great scholar Lord Acton to read on #IndependenceDay Essays on Freedom and Power 
A great primer on the beginnings and meanings of American freedom and our democratic experiment 
Another good book for today from my friend @RandyEBarnett Restoring the Lost Constitution: 
Some poetry in the middle for #IndependenceDay I Hear American Singing Walt Whitman 
Gritty story about courage/strength &amp; our Revolution Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution 
My interns get a reading list. Here are two that explain our freedoms  &amp;  #IndependenceDay
Next a reminder we need to fight for freedom every day &amp; others around the world continue to struggle for theirs. 
Let's continue celebrating #FourthofJuly w/ the greatest rendition of America the Beautiful by Ray Charles 
I'll be back later. In the meantime enjoy family friends and freedom. I'm grateful to fight for liberty every day! Happy #IndependenceDay
Let's finish up this morning with an instrumental version of the Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix. Turn it up. 
Our rights come from our Creator not government. Government is set to secure these rights. We're born free: 
For my next song let's take a listen to some revolutionary music from Metallica Don't Tread on Me  #IndependenceDay
"Let's remember those who fought to make America a country w/ ""treasures for the taking for any hard working man"" "
This song that talks of a hard-fought love for country. Just because it isn't perfect doesn't mean it isn't great: 
There's a lot of patriotic music out there and that's great because we should all celebrate our country and our freedom on #IndependenceDay
May not be everyone's idea of beach reading but something from a modern historian on that time #IndependenceDay 
Let's move on now to the author as he wished to be remembered with Jefferson's autobiography: 
So let's start with something simple but important and re-read the Declaration of Independence:  
Freedom is something we must fight for and be vigilant to protect. 240 years ago a document was signed that made the case for Freedom.
I thought I'd join everyone celebrating #IndependenceDay with some thoughts words and music. Happy 4th of July!

So @HillaryClinton doesn't like your tone @SenSanders? She clearly has never heard your folk album  #ToneDownForWhat

@tomemmer: I'm proud to stand with @MiaLove and @RandPaul on their One Subject At a Time Act.  
The President gets to nominate but the senate must consent and I am not simply going to let him have his way without a heck of a fight.
Combined with the Presidential race it is difficult to conceive of a reason to confirm a judge before the end of this term.
This President has usurped power unconstitutionally and this issue will be before the Supreme Court creating a conflict of interest...

I won't let her do it. I am running to fight for Kentucky and to stop the national democrats from killing more coal jobs.
That's why democrats in Kentucky running for federal and state office have been and should be soundly defeated. They don't represent us.
She vows to finish @barackobama's war on coal and Kentucky. #DemTownHall
Tonight @hillaryclinton said out loud what the national democrat party has been trying to do quietly for the past 8 years #DemTownHall

@Mediaite: See the Six Songs @RandPaul Mockingly Recommends for Clinton’s Campaign Playlist  
@reason: Senator @RandPaul tweeted a mixtape for @HillaryClinton who spent $90000 for her own and it's kind of :fire: 
This has nothing to do with anything but play this loud wherever you are esp if you’re watching the #DemDebate. 
She loves NSA spying on you. We should stand for the entire bill of rights. 6. Every Breath You Take by The Police: 
Hillary's wars in Libya and Syria and her vote to go into Iraq have left us less safe. 5. War by Bruce Springsteen: 
Her $90K playlist has a John Legend song bet it wasn't the one about the failed war on drugs 4. The House I live In: 
h/t to @nbcsnl and this is self explanatory really. 3. I Can't Make You Love Me by Bonnie Raitt: 
.@HillaryClinton ran saying she would take the call at 3am. She didn't. Disqualified. 2. 3AM by Matchbox Twenty: 
We need candidates who will tell the truth. @HillaryClinton isn't one of them. 1. Little Lies by Fleetwood Mac: 
Here's my playlist @HillaryClinton SHOULD be using on the campaign trail free of charge. This will be more enjoyable than the #DemDebate.
90K on campaign songs? I'll help Hillary so next time she can save $ on songs. I am fiscally conservative after all.

If you want people to have more and better access to mental health care lets have more competition not more gov #DemTownHall
Gun show loop hole is a myth!  #DemTownHall
The # of firearms in the US has increased by over 50% since 1993 but our gun homicide rate has shrunk by nearly 50% 
.@BernieSanders there's no correlation between gun ownership and mass shootings  #DemTownHall
But where does Bernie stand on Afghanistan?
Now don't worry Twitter I'll go back to disagreeing with Bernie now #DemDebate
Here's a place where we agree. The Iraq war was a mistake. I wouldn't have voted for it. I filed bill to end it in the Senate #DemTownHall
I agree with Bernie on one thing. We should have a great debate on issues. I've offered to debate him I think it would be very illuminating

"""Because a vision softly creeping. Left its seeds while I was sleeeeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains"""

.@BernieSanders is right. ObamaCare failed. He recognizes it and it needs to be repealed. But more gov doesn't work. More competition does!
@BernieSanders's ideas aren't radical? How is raising taxes by $19.6 Trillion not a radical idea? #DemTownHall
Gov’t involvement never works. Gov’t involvement in healthcare raised prices &amp; gov’t involvement in ed raised tuition costs #DemTownHall
.@BernieSanders just spent five minutes telling you what he thinks a socialist is. I can do it faster. #DemTownHall
Get the gov out of lives and businesses. A constitutional gov and flat tax without loopholes is the answer to the problem #DemTownHall
But I have a different solution. Don't limit speech. Make the government smaller so people have no incentive to buy it #DemTownHall
Sanders talks about Campaign Finance Reform and that too many people are trying to buy things and people in Washington. (1/2) #DemTownHall
How surprised are you by how wonderful this is going for you?? That's the first question? Seriously? #FairandBalanced #DemTownHall
Here comes @BernieSanders! I predict he spends a trillion dollars in the first give minutes. Someone tally it. #DemTownHall
Is this going to be like @AmericanIdol? Can I text in after to vote for the one most likely to be indicted? #DemTownHall

The one thing that is missing - they should all get an apology from @HillaryClinton.
Demaryius Thomas gave his mother a game ball after Peyton Manning handed it to him and said give this to your Mom.
President Obama gave Demaryius Thomas his mother back by commuting what remained of her harsh sentence.
We are reminded when we hear the story of Denver Broncos Demaryius Thomas whose mother received 20 years and grandmother two life sentences
Fed mandatory minimums and 3 strikes &amp; life bills came from Clinton's attempt to look tough on crime. They put a gen of minorities in prison
She conveniently forgets that many of the worst bills that need fixing in our fight for justice are Clinton bills.
In the #DemDebate last night @HillaryClinton tried to ignore her past and that of her husband.
In honor of #MLKDay I visited a barbershop to discuss criminal justice reform. Learn more:

During the commercial break chip in to my campaign! Anything from $2 to $50 makes a huge difference. 
No one has fought harder for your right to privacy and 4th amendment rights than I have  #DemDebate
I am the one candidate from either party who will stand for the entire Bill of Rights. #DemDebate
.@HillaryClinton is correct on 1 thing she spent many hours in Sit Room. Doesn't mean she's qualified #DemDebate 
"Great video from @Rare! ""Why is @RandPaul the only Republican challenging Washington's foreign policy?""  #DemDebate"
Twelve Years Later @HillaryClinton Is Still Defending Her Iraq War Vote  #DemDebate
Her failed war in Libya &amp; arming Syrian rebels allied w/ ISIS made us less safe. It appears she has not learned anything #DemDebate
.@HillaryClinton Your wars in Iraq Syria &amp; Libya strengthened ISIS &amp; yet u still have the audacity to talk about foreign policy? #DemDebate
We cannot let anyone on this stage become elected president. Donate any amount you can afford to help me here: 
Anyone else think that #DemDebate halftime show needed a band?
Talk about foreign policy now. So this will start to sound a LOT like the #GOPdebate without me in it  #DemDebate
Don't have to believe in Big Gov to care about the environment. It can be compatible with freedom &amp; jobs  #DemDebate
"I think I heard @berniesanders say loudly ""THE DEBATE IS OVER"" so goodnight everyone! #DemDebate"
I think the Democrats are taking questions from cartoons. I don't know what that means I'm just pointing it out. #DemDebate
How about we try actually lowering taxes and getting rid of the 70K page tax code? #DemDebate
"I agree with @MartinOmalley again ""What Hillary Clinton just said is not true"" They could just put that under her on the screen all night."
.@HillaryClinton is giving @barackobama a big hug right now in the #Demdebate. @ChrisChristie getting jealous
After working with Congressman Paul for months on his #AudittheFed bill @BernieSanders ‘sold out'  #DemDebate
Want to defeat Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders? I can do it. Donate $2 or $5 to help me beat them 
Another break already? I hope everyone makes it back to from the bathroom in time #DemDebate
.@HillaryClinton free college isn't sustainable but making college tuition tax deductible is.  #DemDebate
The youth vote does matter! That's why I organized @randstudents on college campuses all over the country #DemDebate
So instead of addressing the real costs of his proposals @BernieSanders just wants to shout buzzwords #DemDebate
I want to hear @MartinOmalley weigh in again he seems less angry than @HillaryClinton and @BernieSanders #DemDebate
.@BernieSanders thinks the way to make healthcare cost less is to get the government MORE involved. That has never worked #DemDebate
".@BernieSanders wants ""Medicare for All"" - sure let's take a program that's tens of trillions in longterm debt and make it bigger #DemDebate"
As a doctor I have firsthand experience w/ the immense problems facing health care in the United States #DemDebate

If you're playing #DemDebate bingo tonight you're probably dangerously close to filling out your card in the first 20 minutes #buzzwords
I have called for comprehensive reform measures to fix America’s broken criminal justice system #DemDebate - 
Seriously? @BernieSanders is bragging he has a failing grade on protecting the Bill of Rights #DemDebate
.@BernieSanders just bragged about getting a D- grade. And he wants to fix education. #DemDebate
.@MartinOmalley is seriously happy about his plan to ruin our economy I'll give him that #DemDebate
.@HillaryClinton wants to cut healthcare costs. Try getting government out of the way and let competition work. #DemDebate
.@SenSanders is fine with Super PACs as long as they're supporting him. *See Nurses Super PAC for more details #DemDebate #Hypocrisy
"Surprised @MartinOMalley didn't just open the #DemDebate with 45 seconds of ""This Land is Your Land"""
Are they going to ask the Democrats tons of questions about Donald Trump or is that just for us? #DemDebate
.@Chucktodd makes a good point. Love/hate him ppl r talking about Bernie's proposals. Ppl r talking about Hillary's legal issues #DemDebate
I hope they're going to wear name tags during the #DemDebate tonight so I can tell who the Socialist is...
