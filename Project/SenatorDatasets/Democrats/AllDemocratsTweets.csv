Amidst an abundance of grief: keep going; keep helping; keep comforting; keep loving; and by all means keep demanding justice.
We are not powerless against such evil. We must take common sense widely supported steps to reduce such violence agony and grievous loss.
It is not enough to ask how could someone do this. We must also ask ourselves how can I prevent something like this from happening again.
‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people should do nothing.‚Äù
My soul aches over Las Vegas. My prayers are with the victims. And my prayers are with our nation may we resolve to do more stop such evil.

Transgender Americans in military are heroes like anyone else risking their lives to defend us. @POTUS is wrong: 
You can still reach out to others in Congress. Also: Get Folk Woke.  Advocate to others in other districts and states to fight too. 
Thank you for listening and for being a part of the resistance to this legislation. 
If such a bill passes the mortality rate in our country will rise. We must kill this bill and save the lives of our fellow  Americans. 
When my father died and I was swallowed by grief New Jersey Dems &amp; Repus reached out to me. I love all my state not just those in my party. 
Thank you but today was a grave &amp; awful day. The clock is now ticking. We must all take responsibility to stop this craven Republican bill. 
Kindness isn't weakness or lack of conviction. Kindness doesn't weaken an argument. U don't need to be mean or cruel to be strong or tough. 
I love you too. And I try to live up to my ideals of also loving my enemy. 
I too am engulfed with anger. But I will never let them rob me of my decency. You either submit to the darkness or fight it with light. 
And you too need a hug. We should all show kindness &amp; decency to one another even when our disagreements couldn't be greater. #IHuggedMcCain 
We all must continue the fight in these hours before the vote. Let your voice be heard. 
Thank you for fighting for us. We are all in this together. We must defeat this craven bill.

I was so grateful to do the @PodSaveAmerica interview. Thanks for your feedback. 
I have concerns about corporate consolidation in general but I love my local Newark Whole Foods store and believe it will only get better. 
Such a strong documentary. 
I honor your speech rights but you don't get to name me. May we both draw pride in our roots &amp; honor them through our service to others. 
@sjmorris31 @KillerVegan I've got to get there to try it.
"@AltLeft2017 U are wrong on so many points: I do support Medicare for all &amp; why don't you read the entire article about ""pause"" : "
@kerri_blanchard Kerry Kushners were a major Dem family years ago that supported many Dem candidates. Dems contributions ended years before Trump presidency
Thank you for this point. And there are other urgent health related issues that we need to keep focused on like environmental toxins. 
Kerri you seem confused about me. But I sincerely wish you well and appreciate your advocacy particularly for environmental justice. 
You are so right. Many folks don't understand how our broken food systems and food deserts undermine American health. 
@NaomiYoungstein @0619b0f3ff9b4f8 Thanks for telling the truth Naomi.
Yes. 
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks for being open to the truth.
The Whole Foods at lunch is now a happening place in Newark. Many vegan/vegetarian options. 
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks Ellen. And please read this too: 
@chiweethedog Sorry u believe the many Dems who received contributions years ago from a major Dem family (years before they became Repub) is wrong.
@robinAKAroblimo Hope you will read this whole article:

Love @KillerVegan. Everyone also raves about their Sunday brunch but I haven't tried it yet. 
We do. A major part of Obamacare is about prevention as well as early detection and diagnosis.

They most certainly do. 
@techs4good Thank you!
@Dr_Zil_White Thank you.
I agree and will work to this end. 
There are many vegan/vegetarian friendly spots in Newark. I invite my followers to share their favorites with you.

@RebeccaHassouna You clearly don't read all of my tweets on this subject. Read all my tweets and replies.

@da5idblacksun Read through my tweets and replies to see my responses.
@MelissaFarmer1 @Ohannahmama Not sorry at all that I or 100s of other Dems received support from democrats years before they turned Republican... and not since.
@da5idblacksun What! I (like all other Senate Dems) said outrage is justified and there should be an investigation. Listen to whole interview.
One of the best books I've read in last 4 years. 
Zero evidence? He has contempt of rule of law and tried to influence an ongoing criminal investigation. #InconvenientFacts 
@cjpetersen2012  I sincerely wish you the best.
With 100s of cases they have little time/resources to put up strong defenses against prosecution with leverage of draconian mandatory mins 
Our dedicated public defenders are weighted down with massive case loads &amp; few resources - mockery of the idea of a right to an attorney. 
@icterid And I appreciate your encouragement
@UndrCvrDem @jonfavs @SusanPlattVA @ALT_uscis Really? Pulling a picture from years ago when they were major backers of NJ democrats is your damning evidence?
There's a difference. One is a vicious lie fueled inquiry the other is a legitimate traditional request relevant to the issue of conflicts.

@mareiw1ngz Love you but get the truth: 
We've lost our outrage. We hyper incarcerate the poor sick &amp; minorities at grievous cost &amp; fail to invest in reentry education &amp; treatment 
Since failed war on drugs Fed govt has reduced investment in local police by more than 75% and increased in prisons almost 50%. Madness! 
We can do both. Why pour $$ into failed criminal justice policies?! Redirect to victims assistance &amp; more police and police accountability. 
@TruthDrivenLife @nobleheart56 @MsEnergyHealer @SSandhu21 @PalmerReport It was a frustrating. I have always supported imports. I just want it to be done right and happy that my colleagues agreed &amp; joined the bill

@katieLstein Thank you Katie.
Thanks. So good to be here tonight. 
May we remember folk in prison are still part of our society; we are defined by how we treat them and how we offer them hope for redemption.
From the warden to the incarcerated women who advocated for issues of no direct benefit to them today I saw the power of tireless love.
Again I am grateful for those - especially at today's prison - who pour their heart into their work and affirm human dignity.
America is paying too high a price for a broken criminal justice system that harms too much &amp; helps too little. We must all demand better.
Women face unique challenges in prison. Thanks to insights from the warden staff &amp; women I listened to I'll step up my fight for reform.
We must also do a better job focusing on the reality that so many of the people we incarcerate especially women are survivors of traumas.
Our criminal justice system is broken you see it up close visiting prisons; from excessive sentencing to lack of resources for reentry.
I'm grateful to the professionals who work there - corrections officers medical staff &amp; more - who do hard &amp; difficult work for our nation.
Just finished a visit to another Federal Prison. I visited for many reasons including to learn more about issues facing incarcerated women.

@MonicaJORourke @KaivanShroff Since Trump presidential campaign and a long time before I haven't received such contributions.
@MonicaJORourke @KaivanShroff So sad you believe that taking money from a NJ Dem family years before Trump ascended makes you lose faith. Pretty much every dem in NJ did.
@kylemorgue I've worked tirelessly to support public schools and union teachers (endorsed by NJ teachers unions).
@Wayfinder_Moana I have also worked to support charter schools that serve kids. Those that don't I've advocated for the closing.

@anapazprado You clearly didn't actually listen to my interciew and are wildly mistaken about my work against this Adminstration.
@Pena_Law You are a good &amp; righteous activist. It is sad  if you actually believe what u just wrote. Clearly u know nothing about me or my life work
Spent the morning at home in my neighborhood park in Newark built by the will of defiant grassroots environmentalists. 
@Bexmich Hope u'll actually listen to my interview on the subject. I'm confident our positions aren't that different. Reach out to @ghelmy on my team
This article is deeply disappointing. This kind of intolerance does not advance justice it undermines it.  
@panininef @ghelmy I didn't. Don't read internet reports. Go to the actual interview and see my criticisms.

Today isn't an end of US leadership on global climate issues; instead it is a rallying cry for us to double down in this urgent fight.
I reject President Trump's wanting climate leadership and will not yield in the fight against his dangerous environmental policy.
In a few days from his G7 meetings to his Rose Garden speech Trump has moved us from a position of global leadership to reckless isolation
Trump is wrong: It's not economy vs environment or America vs the world. It's future vs past; progress &amp; opportunity vs retreat &amp; surrender.
Pres Trump's Decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a vicious blow to American leadership in the world and to our future.

I think it's s more than that there are those that perilously believe the free market will solve our nation's health care crisis. #Wrong

Sorry don't buy that Republican lie. The ACA had dozens of hearings Obama had public dialogues with repub legislators a year long process 
"Quality healthcare isn't a ""burdensome tax"" it is an essential element of societal success like public education and access to clean water. "
There is a twisted cruelty to assert we can be a great nation if we only allows access to quality health care to the wealthy &amp; privileged. 
Denying access to preventive care mental healthcare prenatal care etc is WAY more expensive for society than universal access/coverage.

This is the key question: 
@CAPAction: Here's the video of Sessions denying **under oath** that he had communications with the Russians. 
@carolelee: US officials have investigated Jeff Sessions contacts w Russian officials while he was advising the Trump campaign 
There are many legitimate reasons. Sessions should have disclosed it but didn't. Why? He is compromised. Independent investigation now. 
"No. Read his testimony. He's ""explaining"" now. But if what he says is true why not disclose that to the committee? Why hide it? "
He has responded but for the integrity of the investigation he should recuse himself AND join our call for an independent special council. 
Thank you for engaging with me on this platform and for your kind feedback. 
It wasn't a change. I've always supported imports. Happy we have a strong bill that addresses legitimate safety concerns.

There has been much upsetting of recent. But we must take care of ourselves and each other. There is hard work and challenging days ahead. 
Thank you. I'm proud of my testimony against Sessions and it is kind of you to say it inspired you. Thank you. 
At the very least his testimony was (intentionally or not) misleading. His ability to independently investigate is irreversibly compromised. 
Sessions testified that he had no contact with Russian officials. We now know he did. We can not rely on him for an objective investigation. 
The revaluation is deeply disturbing. Sessions should never have been confirmed. Now as before we must have an independent investigation. 
It is sacred civic space. So much about it I am in awe of. But quirky? There is the candy drawer that is both curious and quirky. 
Christos sincerely representing our state is the greatest honor of my life. I so love Jersey. 
Peanut Butter Patties. They are vegan and delicious. 
The candy is so Jersey! They were invented in Newark in the 1940s. One of the best candies ever (but I no longer eat them as I'm now vegan). 
Are you talking about the mode of transportation or @SenSchumer's hoagie? Well actually the answer is yes in both cases. 
I've not only said it but I've introduced legislation (with GOP cosponsors) to do that and more regarding marijuana. 
I'm proud of my many bipartisan bills. It's 1 of best ways I can serve NJ. But when POTUS uses his power to hurt NJ residents I will fight. 
Amen. Let's all work to find common ground. But when people violate our collective values I believe we must stand our ground and resist. 
We all need to heed your advice no matter what our position. 
You are one of my constituents. Please step away from twitter. Get some sleep. I believe in you! 
No. It wasn't a bill. What I did do though is join him in authoring actual legislation allowing imports with strong safety provisions. 
Yes you can. 
I can't sleep Richie and I figured it would be good to have an impromptu twitter town hall. 
No. But I welcome you here in Jersey with open arms. #EmbraceTheGardenState 
I signed up for this and am grateful for the twitter community who follows me. Thanks Karen. 
Love you too. 
Your meme is PAWsome. 
I will be relentless in this fight. It is one reason I opposed Jeff Sessions &amp; also why I cosponsored reform legislation with GOP Senators. 
"As one of my heroes Bryan Stevenson says ""We're a nation that often treats u better if you're rich &amp; guilty than if you're poor &amp; innocent"" "

@NeverCorporate So I went to work with Sen Sanders and Casey to write ACTUAL import legislation with strong safety provisions.
@NeverCorporate Sorry you believe that. The nonbonding resolution I voted against had little in terms of safety.

It was a team effort and I am so grateful to @rasbaraka's leadership and that of his administration for getting this across the finish line. 
Actually I have grave concerns about what they will propose and how it will affect working class and poor Americans. 
@Shayamborghini @MarcoRLamas And take a look at this too: 
@Shayamborghini @MarcoRLamas Finally I hope you will read the actual legislation:  ‚Ä¶
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 4. Our legislation now includes very strong safety provisions.
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 3. I then went right to work with Sen Sanders and Casey to write ACTUAL LEGISLATION that would allow imports.
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 2. I voted against it as I said then because it didn't contain strong safety provisions. . .
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini You're wrong! I'm answering. 1. I didnt vote against cheap meds. It was a nonbonding resolution NOT legislation
@FairlyfocusedOp I constantly attack the 2nd amendment. You must have me confused with someone else.
@MichaelsMary @ghelmy So u are saying that I should have been the last to sit? Or a minute less standing than others makes me a bad person?

@veritasingod 2. I then worked with others to write ACTUAL legislation with Sanders and Casey that allows imports with strong safety...
@veritasingod Sure: 1. I didn't vote against legislation just a nonbonding resolution that didn't have adequate safety language...
Thank you for the kind encouragement. May we all stand up for what is right and let our voices be heard.

Yes hard for a plan to work well when some Republican governors worked to subvert it at the expense of their working poor citizens. 
Like PBO said I'll support a republican plan if it is demonstrably better than what we have. But don't ask me to repeal without seeing it. 
Also PBO spent months engaging thousands on his plan begging GOP leaders to sign on. Plan was known Congressional GOP didn't like it.

129M people are now protected from being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a routine occurrence before Obamacare was enacted. 
"""I'm so proud to have cast my vote for Kamala Harris!"" @USC student Philine Qian. "
Once again 129M people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage and insurers could charge sick people more money.
It‚Äôs shameful that instead of working to protect students this administration chose to benefit debt collectors.

Horrified by what happened in Alexandria this morning. My heart goes out to Steve Scalise staffers the US Capitol Police &amp; their families.
Trump has shown he‚Äôs willing to go to extreme lengths to cut core govt functions to the bone in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy.
Republicans are playing politics with climate change on behalf of Big Oil. We gotta fight.
Senate bill would risk health care of at least 22M Americans. Time to flood Congress with calls in opposition to this bill: (202) 224-3121.
It‚Äôs appalling that the student debt crisis has forced tens of thousands of elderly Americans into poverty.
We stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us as well as the women who are marching in the streets for our civil rights.

For ethical and moral reasons we have to honor our promise made by the US government to DREAMers.
Before the ACA was passed being sexually assaulted was considered a pre-existing condition. We can‚Äôt go back.
Congress‚Äô failure to pass legislation to renew the assault weapons ban is shameful. It is in the best interest of keeping our country safe.
Health care should not be a privilege for a few but a right for all. The bill that passed earlier today won‚Äôt do that.
It is the DOJ that addresses systemic inequalities that exist in our system but it is Senator Sessions who fought against reform.

This is going to be a moment that will challenge all of us to fight for the ideals of our country. There‚Äôs no question the stakes are high.
Instead of relying on knowledgeable staff Pruitt is relying on lawyers &amp; lobbyists to make environmental decisions.
Hate is like a poison in the bloodstream of our body politic but we can‚Äôt let it become the new norm.

Sending my condolences to the family and friends of Janet Reno who broke the glass ceiling as she fought for justice.

In 2016 the uninsured rate in California reached a historic low of 7.4%. We can‚Äôt go back to the way things were. 
Wow America only has only 4.4% of the world's population but almost half of the world‚Äôs civilian-owned guns.

Keeping those killed and injured in NYC in my prayers. Thankful for the quick actions of the NYPD and first responders.
It‚Äôs critical we come together to reform a bail system that is discriminatory wasteful and doesn‚Äôt keep our communities safe.
More than 8 million Californians have paid into the system for decades &amp; earned the right to access Medicare. We can‚Äôt leave them behind.

While Trump disregards the people of Puerto Rico we must remember what‚Äôs happening is a humanitarian crisis and it‚Äôs up to us to help them. 
I know I have big shoes to fill and it is because @BarbaraBoxer has been such an incredible leader for California. 
Just as I‚Äôve done as CA‚Äôs AG I will lead the charge to fight against all forms of discrimination particularly against the LGBT community.

No woman should be told she can‚Äôt run for public office. We must build the infrastructure &amp; encourage women to run. 
We must have transparency &amp; accountability in our criminal justice system especially with facts about race. 
Outside the WH to stand in solidarity w/ refugees and immigrants who are being targeted by this admin. This is not who we are. #NoBanNoWall 
With Trump's health care plan the number of uninsured Americans would rise by 24 million by 2026. That's catastrophic.

These tourists came to New York City to celebrate what should have been a joyous occasion. This is heartbreaking. 
Millions of lives hang in the balance with the final Senate health care vote later this week. 
I will always defend the progress we‚Äôve made to protect our environment and to address the global crisis of climate change.
Here‚Äôs the truth: We need to put an end to oil companies manipulating our laws and poisoning our planet.

The American people deserve a thorough urgent &amp; transparent investigation into Russian attacks on our democracy.
It‚Äôs clear that this administration wants to push the issue of sexual assault under the rug. We can‚Äôt let them. 
So glad to see this little one at our rally in OC with State Senate candidate Josh Newman -- she had a lot to say during the event! 
It is morally wrong for corporations to profit off the mass incarceration of millions of people in this country.

Can you add your name to my petition demanding Sessions resign as Attorney General immediately?
When it comes to health care prevention first is key. If we‚Äôre dealing with sick Americans in the emergency room it‚Äôs too late &amp; expensive
Donald Trump needs to release his tax returns. What does he have to hide?
Americans deserve better than the GOP budget that puts America‚Äôs future at risk and doesn‚Äôt put working families on the path to success.
As a nation of immigrants this #MuslimBan runs counter to what truly makes America great: our diversity and our compassion.

Immigrants helped build this country and ‚Äãcontinue to ‚Äãstrengthen it today. The Raise Act is an attack on our values.
Background checks for gun buyers are necessary to keeping our children safe while they‚Äôre at school.
Proud of California for joining the fight against President Trump's Muslim Ban. 
This is an inflection moment in our history like the Civil Rights movement. We have to ask: what kind of country do we want to be?
Do not underestimate your power. Stay engaged. Fight on.
We must stand up and say we‚Äôre not going to tolerate hatred and bigotry. This is not who we are as a country. We‚Äôre better than this.
Senator Rand Paul and I have introduced a bill to encourage states to reform the money bail system.
#FlashbackFriday to last year‚Äôs #NationalDoughnutDay. Had a blast handing out beignets to people who had been waiting in line for doughnuts. 
The gains that our country has made are not permanent. It is incumbent on the Attorney General to fight for the rights of all our people.
Together we can make this a more perfect union. One where our economy works for everyone including our middle class.
A free press is the bedrock of our democracy. We can‚Äôt lose sight of that no matter what the administration is saying.
We can‚Äôt repeat history. #NoBanNoWall #MuslimBan 
California is leading the way and preparing for increasing wildfires but the federal government must do its part.

‚ÄúSen. Kamala Harris: ACA repeal involves 'moral values'‚Äù
The average student takes on $30000+ in debt. The #CollegeForAll Act would address this &amp; costs beyond tuition including books &amp; housing.
The President of the United States disclosed more to Russian officials than the American public. This isn‚Äôt normal. 
No one should have to be afraid to put a menorah on their front window or on their front lawn.
Let's make sure we have no regrets on November 9th. Get out there and vote tomorrow!
Together we must stand with the millions of Americans who are at-risk if the ACA is repealed. We must not neglect them.
I will never stop fighting for the people‚Äîbe it against this White House Wall Street for-profit colleges or those who target the voiceless

This weekend @JerryBrownGov @DianneFeinstein and I surveyed wildfire damage and met with residents. üì∑: @JerryBrownGov 
@BernieSanders It‚Äôs about making reality the idea that health care is a right for all not a privilege for the wealthy few.
We must use this moment to rededicate ourselves to the cause of justice equality and tolerance while building a coalition for progress.
The fight for civil rights‚Äîthe fight for justice and equality‚Äîmust be fought and won with each generation.
Here‚Äôs how: expand early voting modernize voter registration systems and strengthen protections against discriminatory voting laws.
Tomorrow night Pres. Trump will be giving his first address to Congress. Take a look back at what others have said:
This is a blatant attempt to undermine civil rights protections in communities that need it most.

Leaving future Affordable Care Act subsidy payments up in the air is sabotage plain and simple. 
Instead of creating incentives to house people in prison we should be creating incentives to shut the revolving door into prison.
At a time when our government is led by people who refuse to listen to the voices of the American people we must stay active.

My advice for climate change deniers in Congress: Worry less about you campaign contributions and more about your children.
Citigroup hides $45.2 billion offshore avoiding $12.7 billion in taxes. 
Why do Americans continue to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs when last year just 5 drug companies made $50 billion in profit?
Trump needs to close the revolving door between Wall Street and the federal government not open it up even wider. #DrainTheSwamp 
@HuffingtonPost: Bernie Sanders has a plan to win back Trump voters  
Claims of voter fraud have no basis in reality. An analysis of more than a billion ballots found just 31 instances of impersonation.

"Trump has to learn the very important truth stated by Washington AG Bob Ferguson: ""No one is above the law not even the president."" "
Trump's tax plan is an absolute disaster. Here's why: 
We need to convert our anger into a constructive effort to stop Trump‚Äôs worst policies and force him to help working people not the 1%.
Have you friends or family been addicted to opioids? How has addiction affected you? I want to hear your story. 
Not surprisingly it appears a lot of what Mr. Trump said to win votes is not what he intends to do as president. 
Tonight I would like to hear the president say he will veto any legislation that will make cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

People do not deserve to die because they cannot afford health care. I cannot make it any clearer than that. Health care is a human right. 
The surefire route to success in politics has been to manipulate people's fear and ignorance. We can and will change that.
1 in 5 Americans can‚Äôt afford their medication. Drugs don‚Äôt work at all if patients can‚Äôt afford them. 
This is delusional and nonsensical. The real fraud is that Republicans are changing laws because of so-called voter fraud. 
I find it inconceivable that Republicans continue to ignore the reality of climate change which is the global crisis of our time.
Today at 2 PM: Watch the live stream of the announcement of the Medicare for All Act of 2017

When a promise is made to working people with respect to their pensions and retiree health benefits that promise must be kept.
Too many Americans fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump move us in an authoritarian direction.
The rich get richer and get giant tax breaks while low-income seniors see their social security cut to pay off decades old student debt.
We need fair trade not ‚Äúfree trade.‚Äù Americans should not have to compete against workers in low-wage countries who earn pennies an hour.

I am disappointed by the president's decision to continue pushing forward on the disastrous TPP. It must be stopped. 
My Republican colleagues love to say the U.S. has the best health care in the world. Well these Canadians think otherwise and so do I.

EpiPens are hardly the only unaffordable drug. 1 out of 5 Americans can't afford the medication they are prescribed.

The business model of the largest financial institutions in this country and in fact around the world is fraud.

God only knows what cutting Medicaid by $800 billion would do to the children and people with disabilities living in this country. 
In my view we should not be celebrating individuals who took up arms against the U.S. and defended the horrific institution of slavery.
How can we consider a bill dealing with drug companies without addressing the fact that Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world?
Trump's tax plan will provide virtually no benefit to truck drivers and result in a tax increase for millions of middle class Americans.
In defeating the Dakota Access Pipeline we had to take on the entire fossil fuel industry and once again a majority of Congress.
Here's the simple truth. No one can make it on $8 $9 or $10 an hour. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage ‚Äî $15 an hour.
About 90% of brain development occurs before the age of 5. Yet millions of families are unable to find decent quality child-care.

.@algore continues to educate people around the world on the planetary crisis of climate change. We thank him so much for that. 
Today‚Äôs news that Trump denounced an historic U.S.-Russia arms treaty in a call with Putin is extremely troubling. 
We must learn the lessons of the disastrous war in Iraq and not continue to get sucked into perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
A president intent on keeping us safe wouldn't hand over ideological ammunition to terrorists seeking new recruits to kill Americans.
@RepCummings: Moved by @jimmykimmel‚Äôs story. Working day &amp; night to protect people w/preexisting conditions. We should never go back to‚Ä¶
No one should die because they can't afford medication they need. But that's what happens when we let drug makers charge whatever they want.
@OversightDems: Bernie Sanders has some new allies in fight to bring Canadian drugs to the U.S. 
In fact Eli Lilly and other companies have been fined in Mexico for colluding on insulin pricing.
Why do drug companies charge so much? Because they can. They have outrageously high prices because nobody is stopping them in this country.
There is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little.
About 70% of Puerto Rico still has no power as many as 900 could be dead and thousands need food shelter and clean water. We must help. 
Watch this Danish conservative economist help prove my point: all people should have quality health care higher education and child care. 
To @TheJusticeDept I say: Wall Street won‚Äôt change until we make it clear that no CEO is too big to jail. 
"""To constantly wake up to the news that someone is trying to take away my health care it's just devastating."" - Jasmine Jennings "
Our job: continue the fight for pay equity paid family leave health care and reproductive rights. We must go forward not backward.
NEW: Environmentalist @billmckibben talks about the movement to combat climate change on The Bernie Sanders Show.  
While Americans are dying because they can't afford their medications the 5 largest drug companies made over $50 billion in profits in 2015.
Those of you who have gone to rallies or town meetings: keep showing up keep calling Congress continue to fight. Despair is not an option.
Something is wrong in America when one family the Walton family of Walmart owns as much wealth as the bottom 42% of Americans combined.
We're the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right. Why are we debating whether to take it away from 30 million people?
We should be a country where every veteran who defends this nation gets the health care they have earned and the respect they deserve. 
It is incomprehensible to me that we have more people in jail than China a country with a population that is three times as large as ours.
I hope Trump supporters in rural states understand that what he said during the campaign about standing up for working people was a lie. 
Millions of us have to stand up and tell Mr. Trump to start listening to the scientific community not to CEOs of the fossil fuel industry.
Trump must explain what this military escalation is intended to achieve and how it fits into the broader goal of a political solution.
It really is an embarrassment that Republican politicians with few exceptions refuse to even recognize the reality of climate change.
We need a Secretary of Education who actually supports public education. 
@USNewsOpinion: Bernie Sanders (@sensanders): Import drugs and save American lives. 
Our job now is to rally millions of Americans against this disastrous bill to make sure that it does not pass the Senate.
Making a $1 trillion of investment to repair our infrastructure would create 13 million jobs and that is exactly what we should be doing.
@PattyMurray: It‚Äôs time for a national $15 minimum wage.  #RaiseTheWage
You can't claim to defend freedom then vote to allow the government and corporations to collect more information about our personal lives.
What the American economy should be about is fighting to protect the middle class not indulging the greed of billionaires.
.@realDonaldTrump has picked an anti-labor CEO as his secretary of Labor. What happened to his promise of siding with workers?

Let‚Äôs be clear: America is not broke.  The very wealthy and huge profitable corporations just aren‚Äôt paying their taxes.
Pope Francis is right. Health care should not be a privilege only for the wealthy. 
Let's see if Republican senators believe campaign promises matter. If they do there won‚Äôt be cuts to Social Security Medicare or Medicaid.
I join with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline #NoDAPL 
We must step up to cut our fossil fuel dependence and be a leader in using renewable energy. We have no choice. 
This is America we are not going to pass legislation that allows thousands of people to die.

"@washingtonpost: 22 Nobel Prize winners urge Trump to respect ""scientific integrity and independence"""
No one should profit from imprisoning people especially children. It‚Äôs time to end this morally repugnant business. 
The greed of Mylan and the entire pharmaceutical industry is out of control. 
The Stabenow-Roberts anti-GMO bill contains huge loopholes in the labeling requirement. There‚Äôs not even a penalty for violating it.
There‚Äôs no state where a full-time  minimum wage worker can afford a one-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent. That‚Äôs unacceptable.
The function of prescription drugs should be to protect and improve human health not make drug company CEOs rich. 
Over a third of financial executives have seen potentially criminal wrongdoing firsthand. We can‚Äôt pretend this isn‚Äôt a problem.

We don‚Äôt need more austerity for the middle class. We don‚Äôt need to cut Medicare and Medicaid. It is time for some austerity for the top 1%.
Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote.
Remember: we are still the only major country to not guarantee health care to all its people. We've got work to do. 
Virtually every Western industrialized country has chosen to end capital punishment. The United States should join them. 
Trump said corporations pay the highest tax rates in the world. Not true. 1 in 5 large profitable companies pay $0 in federal income taxes.
With obesity mental health issues and chronic diseases all on the rise we must act on the need for accessible health care for all.
Here's another similarity between Putin and Trump. They're both climate deniers continuing to defend the fossil fuel industry. 
My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents they'd see their kids go to college. We must keep that promise to every family.
"""That's the whole foundation of Wells Fargo is cross-sell cross-sell cross sell."" "
Our political system is corrupt. Billionaires can spend hundreds of millions to elect candidates who will represent them and only them.
Income and wealth inequality is not just a matter of building a stronger economy. It is a human issue. It is a moral issue.
"Yes Mr. Trump climate change is a ""hoax."" It's just an accident that this year will be the hottest on record. "
In a thousand different ways we are taught to think small. We are taught to think we can‚Äôt change the status quo. That does not have to be.
When people stand together when people are prepared to fight back there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.
If low-wage employers paid their workers a living wage taxpayers would have saved $153 billion a year from 2009 to 2011
Growth for the sake of growth isn't worth much if all of it goes to a few people who already have so much.
The greed of the pharmaceutical industry has got to end. Marathon must reduce the price of deflazacort which costs just $1000 in the U.K. 
When people put their lives on the line to defend us the president must listen to them not to the Koch brothers &amp; their extreme ideology.

President Trump‚Äôs refusal to certify the Iran deal is the latest in a series of reckless moves that make Americans less safe.
We need a cabinet that will take action to combat climate change not deny that it exists and is caused by human activity. 
If you look at what Scott Walker has tried to do to unions in Wisconsin it is clear there is a war on the middle class in this country.
We must not make it easier for oil and gas companies to make climate change even worse by exporting the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet.

"The TPP would force American workers to compete with people in Vietnam who are paid 65 cents an hour. That is not ""free trade."""
What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he would stand up for working people Goldman Sachs is running the the Trump administration. 
We must also be aware however that under Trump and Republican policies women‚Äôs rights are being viciously attacked.
The appointment by President-elect Trump of a racist individual like Steve Bannon to a position of authority is totally unacceptable.
Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country. 
Today I finally got the chance to quote President Trump on the Senate floor on how Australia's health care system is better than ours. 
Students who study hard get hit with insurmountable debt while bankers who crashed the economy get a bailout. That‚Äôs unacceptable.
Balancing the budget on the backs of the elderly the sick and the poor must be opposed because it is not only immoral but bad economics.
What concerns me very much is it looks like we have a cabinet of billionaires. I guess they have a few poor millionaires. 
In the wealthiest nation we must ensure all Americans regardless of income have access to mental health care. #WorldMentalHealthDay
The reality is fraud is the business model of both Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. It's not the exception. It's the rule. 
Health care cannot be dependent upon the whims and market projections of large companies whose goal is to make as much profit as possible.
While Republicans want to cut Social Security Tillerson just got a retirement package of $180 million. That's what oligarchy looks like. 
We need universal voter registration so that anyone 18 years of age or older who is eligible to vote is automatically registered.
If we do not address the planetary crisis of climate change we will be judged by future generations and by history in a very negative way.
I also believe there's a strong likelihood Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v Wade denying women the right to control their bodies
Watch this Canadian doctor discuss the difference between practicing medicine in Canada versus the United States. 
Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health care because Congress did not renew funding for the community health center program.
We don't need more tax breaks for billionaires. We need to eliminate student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.

If you can make billions every single year you can pay your employees a livable wage.

Who should benefit from our trade policies?
No one in America in should ever have to choose between their medicine and their food and yet millions have to make that choice every day.
Trump‚Äôs so-called health care plan is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very richest people. 
At a time of massive income and wealth inequality the last thing we need is more tax breaks for millionaires.

Trump received 2.5 million fewer votes than Clinton yet he'll soon be president. Clearly in a democratic society this shouldn't happen.

Apple keeps $214.9 billion in profits offshore avoiding $65.4 billion in taxes. 
We should call the Republican health care plan what it really is:a massive tax break for those who are the wealthiest in America. 
Unbelievably Republicans aren't content with this disgraceful situation. They want to make it even worse. 
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
For the last 40 years the middle class has been decimated. The rich are getting richer. People are tired of it. They want real change.
What is important is not just that we defeated this disastrous Trump-Ryan health care proposal. It is how we defeated them. 
Republicans should worry less about the drug makers funding their campaigns and more about skyrocketing drug prices. 
We spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform debating Obamacare. That was the second longest session in Senate history.

Far from compassionate Trump's budget ‚Äî if enacted ‚Äî would be one of the cruelest in American history. It must be defeated.
The same Republicans now think it's fine for their health care bill to be written behind closed doors without a single committee hearing.
Members of Congress can no longer allow the drug companies to charge our people the highest prices in the world. We have to make a stand.

At a time of massive wealth and income inequality we must do everything that we can to protect and expand pension benefit plans in America.
At a time of massive income and wealth inequality it is absurd to provide huge tax breaks to the very rich.
We have got to from a moral and economic perspective understand that this level of income and wealth inequality is unsustainable.
Reminding ordinary people that government can work for them and can speak with their voice is I believe the hope for America's future.
We must stop Republicans from repealing Obamacare. But we can‚Äôt just play defense. We need to guarantee health care to all as a right.

Tax burdens should not fall on the middle class which is struggling; it should fall on the wealthy who don‚Äôt even pay their fair share.
I hope Republicans understand the consequences of their vote today. When you take 22 million off health insurance many thousand could die.
85% of Americans support letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. The HHS secretary should side with the American people not drug companies.

We have one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country yet Republican governors are working overtime to suppress the vote.
Millions of people voted for Mr. Trump believing that he would keep his word and not cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
Investigators found 31 cases of voter fraud out of a billion votes. That in no way justifies the voter suppression we‚Äôre seeing today.
Anyone who doesn't understand the anxiety and fear of working families has no idea about what's going on in the economy.

Pres Trump‚Äôs plans are based on #alternativefacts &amp; do nothing to keep us safe or fix our immigration system in a humane &amp; effective way.
Democrats in Congress will emphatically oppose these cuts &amp; urge our Republican colleagues to reject them as well. #Trumpcuts

MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal dollars but that money is critical for opioid treatment homelessness prevention &amp; more.
I met with MA opioid addiction treatment providers who give affordable innovative care ‚Äì but they‚Äôre stretched too thin.

.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.
No matter who @realDonaldTrump threatens intimidates or fires it‚Äôs the job of law enforcement &amp; Congress to get to the bottom of this.
The secret to better markets isn't turning banks loose - it's forcing everyone to play by the same rules. Watch: 
"The definition of ""poor leadership"" is sitting at your golf club while millions of US citizens beg for your help @realDonaldTrump."
I spoke with Foxborough resident Chantel on the phone recently. She‚Äôs worried about what cuts to Medicaid would mean for her son's health.

Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
"A bill that is opposed by the @AmerMedicalAssn because it will literally harm millions is not a ""health care"" bill."

Students need accurate comprehensive info to pick the right college but the data @USedgov requires colleges to report is old &amp; incomplete.
Right now we have no #broadband #privacy rules to protect consumers ‚Äì no rules on how companies can collect use share &amp; sell our data.
Health care is a basic human right. We‚Äôll fight as long &amp; hard as we can to make that a reality for everyone in America. #AHCA

I will vote against Betsy DeVos‚Äôs nomination for @USedgov because it‚Äôs not in the best interests of America‚Äôs young people.
@BetsyDeVosED @MassAGO News flash to @BetsyDeVosED: As long as you keep ignoring the law state AGs like @MassAGO will be there to enforce the law for students‚Äã.
The @SenateGOP want to tear apart the ACA ‚Äì rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of people who need it ‚Äì &amp; repeal &amp; run.
Now @SenateMajLdr wants to end the decades-long tradition of letting senators weigh in on home-state judicial noms. 
Let me offer you a word of advice @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.
The @SenateGOP would undo @FCC rules &amp; let internet service providers sell private info without telling customers.
Turns out an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one.
.@realDonaldTrump intends to ‚Äúlet Obamacare fail‚Äù by sabotaging it from inside. We can't let down our guard now. 
For years we‚Äôve fought for a basic rule: retirement advisers should have to put their customers‚Äô interests first. Today that‚Äôs the law. 
#Zika funding isn‚Äôt a place for your selfish partisan games @SenateGOP. People‚Äôs lives are at risk. Bring a clean bill to a vote NOW.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more:

"Congress passed a bill in June to ""help"" Puerto Rico - handing authority over PR to an unelected Board but providing no actual resources."
The new CFTC rule sells out taxpayers &amp; jeopardizes the safety of our financial system. 
The @HouseGOP just voted to strip health care away from millions. We can whimper we can whine ‚Äì or we can fight back. #AHCA 
So @realDonaldTrump is taking his make-believe fact-free stories of voter fraud to a whole new level. 
Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm heading to the Senate floor now to discuss Trumpcare‚Äôs devastating impact on working families. Watch:

.@JohnCornyn &amp; I wrote a bipartisan bill removing obstacles that delay servicemembers' commercial drivers‚Äô licenses. 
@TomCoburn: Should taxpayers know if govt settlements from #bigbanks &amp; corporations are tax deductible? @senwarren &amp; I think so 
The Senate should reject @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs judicial nominees &amp; stop helping the rich &amp; powerful capture our courts.
If you missed my questions for @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf on his gutless leadership earlier today take a look. 
15 months ago I traveled to the Greek island of Lesvos ‚Äì the 1st stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee the terrors of ISIS. 
Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by‚Ä¶ Steven Cohen. Seriously.
I can‚Äôt find a clause in the Constitution that says ‚Äú‚Ä¶except when there‚Äôs a year left in the term of a Democratic President.‚Äù
But the election is over @realDonaldTrump &amp; now you‚Äôre shifting to support changes that would gut Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some like Jamie Dimon are still running the same banks.
Heading to the floor to discuss the @Equifax breach. People are right to be outraged. 
I voted against Rod Rosenstein‚Äôs nomination to the #2 spot at @TheJusticeDept because he refused to commit to a special prosecutor.
.@HHSgov nominee Tom Price proposed a whopping $449 billion in Medicare cuts &amp; $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetGOP.
The @CFPB‚Äôs new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.
Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
Domestic violence survivors crime victims &amp; others should never have to pick between calling 911 &amp; keeping a roof over their heads.
I‚Äôm pleased to announce that I‚Äôll be serving on the Senate Committee on Armed Services in the next Congress.
Today @SenSherrodBrown &amp; I sent a letter to the @WhiteHouse urging President Obama to declassify the TPP agreement. 
This is why we need to pass the Schedules that Work Act to give workers a chance to build some economic security: 
Massachusetts Sec of State Galvin is right to be worried: @realDonaldTrump's bigotry &amp; hate could greatly influence our census results. 
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions ‚Äì until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. 
Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis ‚Äì but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.

Chuck Blahous the GOP Social Security Board nominee has spent his career crusading to dismantle Social Security. 
The FREE Act lets you freeze ‚Äì and unfreeze ‚Äì access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data.
Giant corps can‚Äôt dodge legal obligations to employees. The GOP may not like it but the NLRB is doing its job. 
Warning: calling @Equifax to freeze your credit takes forever and may not even work. We need the FREE Act so freezes are fast and free. 
Keeping these lobbyists &amp; insiders on your team sends a clear message @realDonaldTrump: your campaign was a giant con.
Heading into an election it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.
The @HouseGOP are ramming through a bill this week to roll back Wall Street reform &amp; gut the @CFPB. #wrongchoiceact 
The solution is clear: @realDonaldTrump must divest fully ‚Äì putting his assets in a true blind trust. If he won't Congress must require it.
"Why is Wall St celebrating @realDonaldTrump? Because his administration ""looks like an investment banker‚Äôs dream.‚Äù "

.@realDonaldTrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $17 billion a year.
Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
I agree President Obama. 
At town halls across MA people ask me how to fight back &amp; keep fighting back. Here's the thing about democracy: It's up to all of us. 
The @CFPB just issued a new rule that bans forced arbitration clauses &amp; lets families hold financial firms accountable when they‚Äôre cheated. 
‚ÄúIt just takes political courage and a strong demand from the public to complete the unfinished business of financial reform.‚Äù

Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.

@NWSMiami: 9/10 820 PM Stay in safe shelter we are still experiencing damaging wind gust across South Florida #FLwx
@CFPB The last thing Congress should do is hurt people‚Äôs rights to hold big banks accountable. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed.

Thanks everyone who came to our Springfield office open house! Great talk about how we're fighting for Western MA. 
I‚Äôm glad that many good provisions in the #CuresAct will become law but I‚Äôm disappointed by the price we paid for the GOP to pass the bill.
"""Give states an incentive to increase investments in public ed bring down prices &amp; improve outcomes for students."" "
Raising the minimum wage is good for families and good for our economy. Watch:  #Timefor1010
Read my new @TalkPoverty op-ed on why we need the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors &amp; vets a SS raise:

@presmccartney: Steve Bannon has made some uninformed comments about the Seven Sisters. Today we have our own message for him.

Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard-working American family.
.@WellsFargo‚Äôs Board did little while its low-level employees opened millions of fake accounts to meet their impossible sales quotas.
Cutting off payments that help low-income families afford health insurance is petty cruel &amp; just plain dumb.
And @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs indefensible budget &amp; unforgivable Trumpcare bill cuts the money needed to fight our country‚Äôs opioid crisis.
If @realDonaldTrump will not stand up to Russia the Senate will. We recently passed sanctions against Russia by a vote of 98-2.
Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health:

Tonight @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP gave a giant wet kiss to Wall Street. No wonder Americans think the system is rigged against them. It is.
Honored to spend the day w/ @repjohnlewis a man who changed history. We carry his memories in our hearts. #Selma50 
It's not real accountability if the @Equifax Chairman &amp; CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay or publicly answering questions.
"And ""skinny repeal"" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance. "
.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions ‚Äì a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians ‚Äì in @TheJusticeDept.
Less than .5% of Americans serve in our military. I recently asked Elizabeth Dole @DoleFoundation: how can we all support military families? 
.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bank‚Äôs illegal foreclosures.
We need a real independent prosecutor who @realDonaldTrump can't fire Sessions can't intimidate &amp; Congress can't muzzle. We need it now.
No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we‚Äôve already  lost.
Many thanks to @SenatorTomUdall for reading Coretta Scott King‚Äôs letter on the Senate floor. 
.@BetsyDeVosED has gone out of her way to give shady #4profit colleges everything on their wish list even when it breaks the law.

2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.
College accreditation is supposed to make sure kids get a good education while colleges take taxpayer money. But the system is broken.
Good news: Commissioner Gottlieb announced that @US_FDA will no longer be subject to the hiring freeze.
Before millions are subjected to another data breach like @Equifax ‚Äì we must do something about it. That‚Äôs why I introduced the FREE Act. 
If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation.
The @US_FDA must move toward a blood donor policy based on risk not sexual orientation. Read our letter:

Great news: @TheJusticeDept will end its use of ineffective &amp; dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.

".@paulkrugman is right: there's nothing ""populist"" about @realDonaldTrump's giveaways to financial predators. "
And now the @HouseGOP is gutting its ethics office in the middle of the night ‚Äì hours before the new Congress is sworn in.
Despite all his tough talk on Wall Street @realDonaldTrump is proudly supporting the #wrongchoiceact to ‚Äúundo‚Äù Dodd-Frank. 
In fact @USDOL Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder seems to have little respect for American workers at all.
"Read this @nytimes story on how corporations fund ""independent"" think tank research to push their interests: "
Over 20 military &amp; vets groups supported the @CFPB rule protecting our right to sue banks. @SenateGOP sided with the bank lobbyists instead. 
Tune in tonight! #inners 
The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.
I LOVE the Boston Pride Parade. It shows our Commonwealth and our country at its best.

Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about the @SenateGOP's monstrosity of a so-called healthcare bill. Watch: 
Great speech Mr. President. Looking forward to working with the @WhiteHouse to build an economy that works for all our families. #SOTU
@jonathanweisman: Wow credit card co. tried to screw me by charging an annual fee AFTER I canceled card. Didn't listen. I filed complai‚Ä¶
@BetsyDeVosED @usedgov Is @BetsyDeVosED trolling us with this DeVry hire? It's astounding &amp; it‚Äôs exactly why I launched #DeVosWatch. 
Great morning in Dorchester w/ @ldforry @FelixArroyo &amp; community members at the  @HarvardSNHC Women‚Äôs Health Forum. 
Yesterday I called out @AnthemInc for abandoning people in states because Congress won‚Äôt help them to squeeze huge profits out of patients. 
#NotOnePenny in tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; giant corporations ‚Äì especially not on the backs of everyone else. We'll fight this GOP tax plan.
On my way to the floor to oppose Neomi Rao for head of the Office of Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs. Watch: 
I saw the plastic pool floaties parents put on small children hoping that would be enough to save them if the raft went down. 
Good 1st step @arneduncan &amp; @usedgov to ensure students swindled by Corinthian don't end up further crushed by debt. 
To honor the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing victims &amp; survivors please join us in a moment of silence at 2:49 PM ET today. #OneBostonDay
.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood ‚Äì and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
Bad credit doesn‚Äôt make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits not on their credit scores.
.@USDOL proposed a strong new rule to close the overtime loophole &amp; ensure a hard day‚Äôs work is rewarded with a fair day‚Äôs pay. #overdueOT
Last yr @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem ‚Äútakes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.‚Äù I agree.
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won‚Äôt investigate him.
Every time I tweet or post about @Navient students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant.
.@SenateDems &amp; I have asked @SenOrrinHatch to include outside witnesses for Mnuchin‚Äôs @USTreasury hearing.  
We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder‚Äôs burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month: 
.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs @usedgov budget is an all-out assault on America‚Äôs kids teachers college students &amp; student loan borrowers. 
We uncovered data that instead of simply discharging the loans of Corinthian‚Äôs victims @usedgov pushed 80k of them to debt collectors.
How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country's gun policies?
The Senate should confirm Vivek Murthy a highly qualified MA doctor &amp; national public health advocate. America needs a #TopDocNow
Delaying the Volcker Rule is one more giveaway that lets Wall Street have more time to make risky bets. 
Were you or someone you know hurt by Steve Mnuchin OneWest Bank or Financial Freedom? Tell the @SenateDems: 
As we‚Äôve seen with the recent Russian cyberattacks the nature of our national security threats is changing and we need to change too.
We were sent to Washington to work for the American people not Citigroup. Watch the floor speech I just gave here: 
We cannot nickel-and-dime the #Zika health emergency response. That‚Äôs not how science works. Watch: 
.@realDonaldTrump should stand with working Americans &amp; uphold @POTUS‚Äôs protections. Read my new @CNN op-ed. 
The President of the United States should condemn bigots @realDonaldTrump. Not give them a West Wing office to decide our country's future.
We should all be very worried if a @realDonaldTrump Education Dept will stand up for students being ripped off at shady for-profit colleges.
MGH Chelsea keeps families healthy &amp; strengthens our community. They know what repealing the ACA &amp; gutting Medicaid means to MA families. 
When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras the @HouseGOP gets to work ‚Äî both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable.
Trade deal supporters have said again &amp; again they would protect workers. The facts show decades of broken promises: 
Ending DACA would tear apart families &amp; rip young people away from the only country they‚Äôve ever known. #saveDACA
About to speak at the @shankerinst &amp; @AFTunion on #affordablecollege. Watch live or follow along here for updates: 
@bpolitics: Why Obama is wrong and @SenWarren is right on their trade bill quarrel 
These common-sense gun reforms are THE VERY LEAST we can do to help keep our loved ones safe. #DisarmHate
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only 1 problem w/ the over-taxation story: it‚Äôs not true. There‚Äôs a problem w/ the corporate tax code but this isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù #npclive
Mylan‚Äôs promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
Sen @MarkWarner @RepCummings &amp; I filed a new bill today to strengthen oversight of derivatives &amp; prevent bailouts: 
‚ÄúBecause I cannot believe that in 2015 the US Senate would be spending its time trying to defund women‚Äôs health care centers.‚Äù #StandwithPP
Congratulations Ambassador @SenScottBrown! Best wishes to you &amp; Gail in New Zealand. I know you‚Äôll make us proud.
.@realDonaldTrump and his team have given one handout after another to Big Oil and Big Coal since taking office.
I‚Äôm heartsick for Texas. Houston is where I lived after I got married at 19 graduated from college &amp; got my 1st full-time law-teaching job.
And I urge my @SenateGOP colleagues: Listen to the world‚Äôs best doctors who say repealing the ACA would be devastating for their patients. 
I asked a top banking lobbyist: If struggling student loan borrowers can't file bankruptcy what can they do? 
If Rep Tom Price won‚Äôt commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americans‚Äô health care he‚Äôs not the right person to run @HHSgov.
Tune in now to watch @HELPCmteDems‚Äôs confirmation hearing with Tom Price for @HHSgov secretary: 
We don‚Äôt know who is going to have the next big idea in this country but they‚Äôre probably going to need to get online to do it.
Anyone who cares about access to mental health care benefits under the GOP health plan needs to watch @RepJoeKennedy‚Äôs video right now. 
Last week @CFPB @ILAttyGeneral &amp; @AGOWA all sued @Navient (fmr Sallie Mae) for cheating students. 
.@BetsyDeVosED hired a former DeVry official to be the cop in charge of policing sham colleges at @usedgov. 
We wrote a report on perks advisers can get for selling retirement products ‚Äì even bad ones.  #SaveYourSavings
@BarackObama @USDOL Good news: We put a stop to the predatory conflicts of interest that cost Americans saving for retirement $17B/yr. 
4 yrs ago today the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act‚Ä¶ but we still have more work to do. #TalkPay #PaycheckFairness
@MassEMA: #BREAKING Per @MassGovernor #travelban will be fully lifted as of midnight tonight #MAsnow #alert
With the @Equifax breach I‚Äôll be pushing for the same type of corporate accountability that I sought in the @WellsFargo scandal. 
@SenGillibrand: Strongly support @USDOL overtime rule &amp; urge #OMB to finalize it--would benefit millions of hardworking American workers‚Ä¶
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need.
If @SenateGOP seriously think they can hold the gov hostage to protect political corruption w/o anyone noticing they'd better think again.
I‚Äôm fighting @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP's gift for the bank lobbyists until the very end. Watch live now: 
Congress must immediately take up an appropriations bill to come to Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands‚Äô aid.
If only getting folks to do the right thing were this easy in Washington. #summershack  #youmadetherightchoice 
Today I called on the @SenateGOP to consider 10 nominees already passed through Judiciary. They said no.  #DoYourJob
Human trafficking is an ugly stain on humanity and we need to use every possible tool to stop it.
What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
@MassNurses: MNA Western Mass nurses with @SenWarren at the Pioneer Valley Central Labor Council breakfast this morning 
How can @realDonaldTrump can show whose side he's on? He can start by publicly calling this what it is: white supremacy.
But let‚Äôs be clear: The Republicans‚Äô so-called ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù bill comes back to life more often than the lead zombie in a horror movie.
.@realDonaldTrump swindled thousands of students at his sham ‚ÄúTrump University.‚Äù That‚Äôs not up for debate anymore ‚Äì that‚Äôs a fact.
Glad to join you! @NPWF Thank you to @SenWarren @rosadelauro @repdonnaedwards @dianefeldman for taking part in an important conversation
Republicans concluded that bipartisan medical innovation in the #CuresAct would require a raft of giveaways to giant drug companies.
Consumers need a central place to turn to for help when they are denied coverage for mental health care. Watch: 
Data nerds at the CBO confirm that the @SenateGOP ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill would knock 32 million off their insurance. 
Consider this MY warning: We won‚Äôt be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
.@PRyan That's why Dems are fighting for paid sick time family leave &amp; schedules that work - bills your party repeatedly blocks.
Last year every GOP senator voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act. It's long past time for #EqualPayNow. 
There‚Äôs a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers.
Paid sick days a higher min wage &amp; discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump.
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court. Watch: 
The American people deserve better than @SenateMajLdr &amp; the @SenateGOP‚Äôs judicial blockade. Watch:  #DoYourJob
.@usedgov should stop dragging its feet &amp; grant immediate relief to fmr Corinthian students. Read our letter to ED: 
.@HUDgov grants &amp; loans must be about helping the American people ONLY ‚Äì not @realDonaldTrump's personal fortune.
Another terrific town hall in Salem tonight! Glad to answer people's questions &amp; talk about how I'm fighting for MA families in the Senate. 
@SenateDems: The House GOP wants to profit off students. Senate Democrats want to keep rates low. #DontDoubleMyRate 
I support the @WhiteHouse‚Äôs executive order to #BanTheBox on federal job apps. A criminal record shouldn‚Äôt mean a life sentence of poverty.
This morning the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present.
Millions of seniors vets &amp; disabled Americans struggle on Social Security &amp; without a cost of living raise they're struggling even more.
.@USTreasury shouldn‚Äôt drag its feet to say that 387k people's cancelled student loans aren‚Äôt taxable. 
Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance &amp; Medicaid access. 
Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important. 
I'm very grateful for the work of our brave first responders to keep all of us safe during this weekend's storm. #MAstorm
It‚Äôs hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee. The Senate should reject Betsy DeVos. 
.@RepCummings &amp; I will be on @PoliticsNation with @TheRevAl in just a few minutes to discuss our Middle Class Prosperity Project. Tune in!
Someone was murdered at a Neo-Nazi rally today. That happened. In America. In 2017. It's time to make clear where we stand ‚Äì all of us.
I proudly stand with teachers to send a message to @realDonaldTrump and Education Secretary @BetsyDeVos: NO cuts to public education. 
.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
I'll miss @nikiinthehouse when she retires &amp; MA will miss her leadership. But Niki's still got a lot of fighting left to do until then.
.@SenJeffMerkley @DunkinDonuts .@SenJeffMerkley is one of the best and I‚Äôm very glad to fight side-by-side with him. #StopGorsuch #holdthefloor
Cabinet officials must put our country's interests before their own. No conf hearings should be held until we‚Äôre certain that‚Äôs the case.
The opioid epidemic hits all of MA so we surveyed health providers about how we can improve &amp; expand their work. 
Republicans are voting on a bill that would pull the rug out from under state retirement plans. Why? The @USChamber likes the system rigged.
By attacking thousands of troops @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness.
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.
Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
The @rooseveltinst recently released a very thorough report on corporate financial &amp; monopoly power: 
Thanks @MassGovernor &amp; state leg for establishing the permanent Council on the Underground Economy to protect workers
Insightful report from @ColorofChange &amp; @ACLU about how the for-profit bail industry traps people in jail &amp; debt. 
Today I spoke in support of a Constitutional amendment to regulate campaign finance &amp; rein in money in politics: 
Muslims Latinos &amp; LGBTQ Americans protect our country. They‚Äôre part of service member families. They‚Äôre part of our great American family.
The latest @SenateGOP budget is garbage. We must fight back to protect the people we love and the programs we care about. 
Heading to the floor now to call on Puzder to withdraw &amp; urge my colleagues to vote no on Mulvaney for OMB. Watch: 
If we raise the overtime threshold millions of people ‚Äì including 281k in MA ‚Äì will qualify for OT. #overdueOT 
MA has permanent kiosks to drop off unused opioids &amp; also dropoff locations on Saturday. Find one near you: 
Today @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCantwell @SenAngusKing &amp; I are reintroducing the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act.  
Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed then what's your plan for student loan debt? 
Watch @VP Pence &amp; the @SenateGOP give a giant wet kiss to Wall Street late last night while they thought you weren‚Äôt looking. 
Selling out to these corporations might be @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs style but we must do better as a nation and tackle climate change head-on.
.@RepCummings &amp; I asked @USGAO to review @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs taxpayer-funded transition today.  
Read my @nytimes op-ed about how Congress should fix our broken corporate tax code: 
Evidently the GOP believe the single most important issue facing our nation is to let employers deny women access to birth control coverage.
Had a great talk w/ @RepTierney &amp; college students in Boston today about #BankonStudents &amp; how to help young people afford an education
"""Set aside debates about big gov vs. small gov more gov vs. less gov. The most important thing we need is accountable gov."" #CAPIdeas"
When the GOP tried to repeal the ACA some ‚Äì like @BCBSMA ‚Äì fought for their customers. But not @AnthemInc.
My friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris has a new Senate twitter account! Follow her now to join our fight. 
.@realDonaldTrump appointed a bigot as his WH Chief Strategist. This is a moral test for all of us ‚Äì including the business community.
Today I stood with @SenSanders to support his Medicare for All bill. Health care is a basic human right &amp; we fight for basic human rights. 
What a party for marriage equality at the MA State House! Here's my view from the podium. #LoveWins #WickedProud 
The CEO of @BostonChildrens says the @SenateGOP bill is ‚Äúrejection of our commitment to children &amp; their families.‚Äù 
After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings.
Just introduced an amendment with Senators Manchin Murray Brown &amp; Schatz to strengthen &amp; expand Social Security. 
When workers leave jobs retirement accounts get left behind. Up to 30% of retirement plans &amp; hundreds of millions $$$ are lost/neglected.
Our MA state senators are worried about @realdonaldtrump's budget cuts for their communities. Glad to hear their concerns in DC today. 
If AG Sessions were truly recused he should have had nothing to do with firing Comey. He promised to recuse. He broke that promise.
Today I met with community leaders &amp; local officials in Worcester &amp; Springfield &amp; listened to family of people struggling to survive in PR. 
Kids kicked off Head Start srs denied meals crushing student loan debt &amp;GOP makes denying women healthcare #1 issue 
The job of @HHSgov sec is to ‚Äúenhance &amp; protect the health‚Ä¶of all Americans.‚Äù I‚Äôm not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.
"""Here in America we embrace &amp; defend democracy.  And we do that by demanding that everyone in our government is accountable."" #CAPIdeas"
12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.
Steve Mnuchin would get to decide how to regulate 30 of our biggest banks ‚Äì including the bank where he currently serves as board member.
I still oppose the 21st Century Cures Act. The American people deserve a better deal. 
My new report shows: NIH funding is critical for MA scientists. But @realDonaldTrump wants to cut NIH by $5.7B.  
Unemployment is 4% for white Americans. It‚Äôs 9% for African-Americans. Economic recovery has never fully reached Black &amp; Latino communities.
Until the @CFPB no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.
.@SenJeffMerkley I thought @SenJeffMerkley‚Äôs staff might need a sugar boost so with Jeff on the phone I dropped off @DunkinDonuts to his office. 
I didn‚Äôt think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women vets Obamacare PP AND clean water all at once ‚Äì but they did it. #Zika
Vaccines are safe effective &amp; our best chance to protect children from diseases that can kill them. Watch: 
Today we remember and honor the memory of MLK Jr. ‚Äì a man who dedicated his life to nonviolence justice and equality ‚Äì and his dream.
Enjoyed joining small businesses from across MA at the Business Matchmaker in Roxbury yesterday: 
It‚Äôs abundantly clear: the @SenateGOP don‚Äôt have the votes for their tax cut bill ‚Äì or the votes to repeal the ACA. 
On #WorldCancerDay support the Medical Innovation Act to increase NIH funding for cancer research. #NIHSwearJar 
But even after recusing himself Sessions recommended that the President fire FBI Director Comey ‚Äì who was leading the Russia investigation.
Every @FinancialCmte R also voted to take away the authority that the @CFPB used to hold Wells Fargo accountable for the fake accounts scam.
.@RandPaul is fighting for an amendment to the annual defense bill that would repeal the AUMF &amp; give Congress six months to replace it.
And any politician who won't stand with Flint MI - whose kids are choking on poisoned water - lacks the moral courage to serve in Congress.
Glad to hear the House has passed the Senate's version of #VAWA. It plays a vital role in combating domestic violence &amp; sexual assault.
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman‚Äî a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
And on Monday I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America‚Äôs workers. 
MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs order on local immigrants.
I urge @realDonaldTrump: embrace policies that reflect America‚Äôs core values &amp; protect our ntl security. Rescind this executive order now.
Great MA Business Matchmaker event in Framingham today ‚Äì connecting local companies w/ gov contracting opportunities. 
Partial fill policies for opioids can help reduce the number of unused pills in circulation. Watch:  #partialfillbill
Despite endless attacks &amp; scare-mongering the ACA is still standing 5 yrs later &amp; improving millions' health. The facts are in: #ACAworks
"@whitehouse: ""Through days that would test even the sturdiest of souls Boston‚Äôs spirit remains undaunted."" ‚ÄîPresident Obama: "
Read FBI Director Comey's testimony for tomorrow's hearing. This whole thing is crazy. 
Even with @WellsFargo cheating its customers left &amp; right the @GOP wants to roll back the rules &amp; shield big banks from accountability.
Today we listen we remember and we continue the fight. #Selma50 #MarchOn 
.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
I‚Äôm not at all convinced that working people can rely on William Emanuel to stand up for their rights. I opposed his confirmation to @NLRB. 
@MassEMA: TORNADO warning for parts of #Middlesex county till 500PM. Take cover now!   #alert
It's time to end the discriminatory ban on blood donations from gay men. Read the letter I signed today to @HHSGov: 
Happy to keep the Labor Day celebrations going with the Pioneer Valley CLC today! 
Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes.
Financial companies pour money into Washington. Their lobbyists swarm the place. The @HouseGOP‚Äôs #WrongChoiceAct is their reward.
You have to wonder @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?
Of all the words that @realDonaldTrump could pick Trump called his healthcare plan ‚Äúmean.‚Äù Mean for hard-working Americans.
.@SenateGOP withdrew their latest health care repeal bill because they didn‚Äôt have the votes. I have two words for you: Thank You. 
On the 50th anniversary of the VRA we remember: Voting rights are civil rights. It‚Äôs time to #RestoreTheVRA. 
"‚ÄúThe student loan complaint system should be moved out of @usedgov and over to the @CFPB."" #affordablecollege "
.@realDonaldTrump's record is clear: over and over he‚Äôs delivered one sucker punch after another to America's workers. #LaborDay
@SenatorCarper: I urge President-elect Trump to take the advice of the Office of Government Ethics and divest his business holdings 
My colleagues can learn a lot about the success of companies like @RoxTech. I'm glad Beth could join me today. #jobs 
The GOP spent yrs gutting voting rights &amp; suppressing black &amp; Latino votes. We can‚Äôt allow @realDonaldTrump to turn the clocks back more.
Perhaps @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP didn‚Äôt get the message Saturday: We‚Äôre not taking women‚Äôs rights back ‚Äì not now &amp; not ever.
.@usedgov Sec @BetsyDeVosED put bogus #4profit colleges ahead of students vets &amp; taxpayers by illegally delaying an Obama Admin rule.
The President‚Äôs outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
.@realDonaldTrump ran 4 companies through bankruptcy. Now he plans to bankrupt our country.
Read my office‚Äôs new #LaborDay report on how @realDonaldTrump has betrayed America‚Äôs working men &amp; women. 
Heading to Senate floor now to discuss Wall St lobbyist efforts to sneak provisions into must-pass bills: Watch: 
Our federal govt must commit to helping the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. US citizens deserve that much from their govt.
If student loan refi means $70/month more in your pocket that's $ you can put into retirement saving. #SaveYourSavings
We had a great discussion about college affordability at @stonehill_info this afternoon. #bankonstudents 
Within a week Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic.
Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.
@EMKInstitute: #OTD in 2015 @SenWarren was at the Institute for a #GettingToThePoint convo on equality. See the program: 
@MassAGO: Edie‚Äôs life was a testament to the power of small acts of courage. She will be missed but will never be forgotten.

@ByronTau 
Today I spoke at a #WorkingFamilies forum w/ @USDOL in Cambridge on why we need #equalpay #raisethewage &amp; #BankOnStudents
We need a strong Conflict of Interest Rule to protect families &amp; ensure a level playing field for advisers who do right by their clients.
Also glad to participate in a roundtable talk with entrepreneurs at @Running_Start a Worcester start-up work space. 
25 Senators asked @SenOrrinHatch to hear from OneWest Bank foreclosure victims at Steve Mnuchin‚Äôs @USTreasury hearing. He refused.
A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions ‚Äì seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
Dr. Pursley says cuts to Medicaid could be the largest threat facing our children that he‚Äôs seen in his 30 years on the job: 
Great to join Charlestown High students @MassDHE &amp; @MassEducation this morning to talk college #finaid &amp; @FAFSADayMA 
This year taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.
@SenatorLankford The bipartisan #TruthinSettlements Act passed unanimously through the Senate in the last Congress. It‚Äôs time to make this happen.
Thank you @MassGuard for a great visit to Barnes this week and for all you do to keep MA and US families safe 
If you‚Äôre going to #draintheswamp prove it @SenateGOP. Protecting 2 men who lied during their job applications isn‚Äôt the way to start.
Attorney General Eric Holder agrees - the big banks are too big to fail and too big to jail.

Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied &amp; cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didn‚Äôt want to hear those stories today.
.@SenateGOP can wave their hands and say everyone will be fine ‚Äì but here‚Äôs what will happen to our seniors if this bill passes. 
Most people assume that. It explains why ppl lose $17B/yr trusting retirement advisers. #SaveYourSavings 
Boston isn't waiting for Congress to step up &amp; make debt-free college a reality. Great work @marty_walsh! 
@nielslesniewski: @wgdb: Elizabeth Warren Leads Progressive Charge but Has GOP Admirers Too 
Big Pharma has hijacked the 21st Century Cures Act. About to speak on the Sen floor about my concerns with the bill. 
The only way for @realDonaldTrump to truly eliminate conflicts is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust.
.@WellsFargo will never change if the people responsible for the fake accounts scam are still in charge. CEO Tim Sloan needs to be fired. 
What a gorgeous day in Buzzards Bay celebrating our graduates from the Mass Maritime Academy! 
New protections making sure Americans are paid overtime &amp; aren‚Äôt exposed to deadly chemicals could turn to dust with @realDonaldTrump.
.@realDonaldTrump's attack on the ACA's birth control mandate not only attacked reproductive rights. It attacked women's economic freedom.
Glad to see @US_FDA recognize that over-the-counter hearing aids can improve access to millions of Americans. 
Raising the minimum wage isn‚Äôt just about economics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about our values. @WhiteHouse Congress: let‚Äôs finally do this. #SOTU

Instead of embracing the bigotry of his rallies I urge @realDonaldTrump to reverse his decision to nominate @SenatorSessions for AG.
MA is challenging Betsy DeVos's illegal attempt to protect fly-by-night schools that cheat students &amp; bury them in mountains of debt.
Sending my best wishes to @SenThomTillis &amp; his family this morning. Hope you have a very speedy recovery!

Starting now: Sen Klobuchar &amp; I are holding a meeting on the student debt crisis. Watch live:  #bankonstudents
Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
Happy Birthday @usairforce! Happy to celebrate last week by speaking with Senior Airman Schultz of Springfield now deployed to SW Asia. 
Still banned from floor but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this AM to say: Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. 
We cannot miss: It was a terrorist with hate in his heart &amp; a gun in his hand who killed all those people. #filibuster #holdthefloor
The Koch Brothers are dumping enormous resources into grooming &amp; bankrolling anti-gov zealots for top gov positions.
.@SenatorBarb is the fearless leader for women in the Senate. I'll miss my friend when she retires. 
Like Judge Gorsuch Judge Amul Thapar made the list of 21 ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù judges that far-right groups handed to Donald Trump.
A marriage between @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs toxic racism &amp; @RepHensarling‚Äôs Wall Street giveaways is a path to ruin for our country.
I'm grateful to the men &amp; women who made this trip to Afghanistan possible.

Even worse Trump &amp; the GOP want Dems to blue slip (aka rubber-stamp) their pro-corporate right-wing nominees to advance. It‚Äôs insulting.
Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
I'm disappointed that the filibuster reform agreement is not more extensive but some change is better than no change at all.
It‚Äôs clear the Trump admin had 1 goal: to sabotage the ACA. @realDonaldTrump should stop the malicious attacks on US families &amp; do his job.
Federal agency appointees can face jail time if they make official government decisions that affect their own financial interests.

The GOP will have to own every 5-4 case that opens the floodgates even more to secret spending in our political system.
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign ‚Äì but as @POTUS we're finding out whose side he's really on.

MA residents have been writing calling emailing me ‚Äì deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried.
You‚Äôd think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business right?

Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.
I‚Äôm very sorry to hear about Sen. Edward Brooke‚Äôs passing. He was a trailblazer for Massachusetts and our country. 
We're here on the Capitol steps fighting back against this immoral vote to repeal Americans' health care. 
The fight over @CFPB‚Äôs arbitration rule is about whose side you stand on: big Wall St banks or military families. 
Today the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about ‚Äúrestructuring‚Äù the @CFPB ‚Äì another way of saying they want to weaken it.
But does anyone seriously believe @realDonaldTrump fired the top person investigating his ties to Russia because he was unfair to Hillary?
If a credit card company cheats you it‚Äôs hard to hold them accountable. Financial contracts often block you from banding together in court.
Heading to the Senate floor to oppose DOJ nominee Rachel Brand &amp; reintroduce my #BankonStudents refi bill. Watch: 
But when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say they‚Äôll be fine.
The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.
Nope ‚Äî right now on the House floor Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
".@SenOrrinHatch said Mnuchin's bank's disgraceful actions are ""essentially unrelated"" to his qualifications. Tell that to his victims."
I told MGH Chelsea: The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill is just the same set of terrible policies with a fresh coat of paint. 
I #StandWithPP for my daughter my granddaughters &amp; women of MA. We will NOT let the Senate GOP defund @PPFA &amp; deny women basic healthcare.
Glad to answer as many questions as possible during our office hours at CityStage in Springfield this morning. 
We need meaningful inclusion of women in NIH trials to ensure women get the medical care they deserve. Read more: 
Had a great visit in Worcester today at Technocopia a fascinating non-profit robotics incubator. 
.@WellsFargo‚Äôs shareholders get to decide if they will hold their board accountable for their bank‚Äôs fraud or just give them a free pass.
Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
Met with Suffolk County DA Dan Conley today about the @casamyrna MA 24/7 domestic violence hotline SafeLink. #vawa 
Check out my op-ed w/ @CoryBooker on @USDOL‚Äôs new rule for retirement advisers:  #SaveYourSavings
Our government should work for everyone ‚Äì not just millionaires &amp; billionaires. We can fight back by rejecting Judge Thapar‚Äôs nomination.
@RonWyden: Voting now to #BankonStudents &amp; allow hard-working students to refinance their loans. #SenateBudget 
Trumpcare isn‚Äôt a health care bill. A bill that destroys health care for millions to shovel cash to the rich isn‚Äôt a health care bill. #AHCA
This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin‚Äôs dealings with Russia both before &amp; after the election.
@femaregion1: #NewEngland follow your State Govt Officials for important #blizzard updates. List of accounts providing info at:  ...
If the @SenateGOP want to destroy health care in America I will fight them every step of the way.
".@realDonaldTrump Yesterday @realDonaldTrump signed orders that could make it harder to rein in ""too big to fail"" financial firms. "
Let me spell it out loud &amp; clear GOP: If you try to defund @PPFA we‚Äôll fight you every step of the way - &amp; win. 
When tragedy strikes we are one family. We cry together. We pray together. We help each other together. 
Congrats @SenScottBrown on your nomination for New Zealand Ambassador! You have my support &amp; I'm sure you'll make the people of MA proud.
.@GOPSenFinance didn‚Äôt want to hear Colleen ‚Äì an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin‚Äôs bank.
Yesterday my @SenateBanking Democratic colleagues &amp; I asked for a hearing with the @WellsFargo CEO &amp; Board Chair.  
The @CFPB's new rule stops forced arbitration clauses. Surprise surprise: bank lobbyists hate it. They want Congress to reverse it ASAP.
Thanks everyone for coming to our Springfield open house today! I'm happy to fight for Western MA in the Senate. 
We don't know what @realDonaldTrump is hiding in his taxes. What new tax scams he's running. Which foreign dictators have him on the take.
Once again a court has put a stop to another extreme &amp; discriminatory policy of this President. 
Thank you @POTUS for rejecting #KeystoneXL - &amp; thanks to the many people from MA &amp; nationwide who fought for this big day to happen.
@MassChallenge: Proud to be sharing #startup success stories with @SenWarren and @MarkeyMemo: 
"""A vote to defund @PPFA is a vote to defund cancer screenings &amp; birth control &amp; basic health care for millions of women."" #StandwithPP"
It‚Äôs time for Washington to make different choices and make the government work for the middle class once again.
"""Skinny repeal"" should be called ""gut it and run."" Voting to destroy insurance markets and kick millions off health care remains immoral. "
On the floor I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: 
‚ÄúIf colleges help students graduate in 4 yrs instead of 5-6 students save $ on tuition &amp; the gov saves $ on aid.‚Äù 
@FaithNPolitics: .@SenWarren and her husband take in the moment on the Edmund Pettus Bridge #FPI15 
1st order of business for @HouseGOP after a 7-wk recess? Not Zika. Not LA flooding. Just a pile of bills to weaken the rules on Wall Street.
If CEOs won't reinvest profits in their workers what can we do to fill that void? Watch yesterday's banking hearing: 
I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best ‚Äì but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA! 
Budget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a ‚Äúsad sick joke‚Äù and that he finds the agency ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù
I'm grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for organizing our bipartisan trip to Pakistan &amp; Afghanistan this week. 
The future of 700k Dreamers as American as you &amp; me hangs in the balance. Do your job Mr. President. Stop playing politics &amp; fix this.
One quarter of all women in the US are victims of domestic violence. We must re-authorize the #VAWA. 
The @SenateGOP are bypassing important steps to make sure these billionaire cabinet nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest.
Way to go Sydney! Thanks for all you do for Massachusetts students 
@ErinBrockovich: Like a musician meeting a Beatle #Starstruck @SenWarren -- talking about the need for sensible chemical reform #TSCA ht‚Ä¶
Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare @SpeakerRyan?
Glad to see the @WhiteHouse‚Äôs proposal to guarantee overtime to nearly 5 million Americans. A hard day‚Äôs work deserves a fair day‚Äôs pay.
The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING ‚Äì docs hospitals economists even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster.
Tonight's 13th town hall of year was our biggest yet: 1500 people filled Concord Carlisle HS's auditorium cafeteria &amp; lawn. THANK YOU! 
The Fed needs governors who look out for Main Street not Wall Street. Read my @WSJ op-ed with @Sen_JoeManchin: 
I was happy to join today's kickoff celebration of the Boston Harbor Dredging Project ‚Äì deepening the harbor to allow bigger ships. 
@SenMarkey: I stand with @SenWarren and her #BankOnStudents amendment to #GOP #SenateBudget. We must protect Pell grants. 
The @FBI released @HillaryClinton‚Äôs info citing ‚Äúintense public interest.‚Äù It should do the same for its Wall Street FCIC investigations.
Heading to the Senate floor with my Democratic colleagues to demand a vote on #BankonStudents right now. Tune in: 
.@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workers‚Äô retirement savings from shady financial advisers.
"‚Äú‚Ä¶[Trump's] desire to impress his Russian buddies does not outweigh the safety security &amp; lives of Americans &amp; our allies."" #CAPIdeas"
@USDOL: COMING UP: Twitter chat w/ @LaborSec @CoryBooker &amp; @SenWarren on new rule. Tweet Qs w/ #SaveYourSavings 
Serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.
Rex Tillerson may try to dodge accountability in the US Senate ‚Äì but @ExxonMobil certainly won‚Äôt dodge accountability from @MassAGO Healey.
This @BostonGlobe story shows that the student debt crisis is real ‚Äì and it's even worse than we imagined. 
Now the @SenateGOP is obsessed with using the Congressional Review Act to kill every consumer protection rule in sight like the @FCC rules.
Today in the Banking Committee I spoke about @RepHensarling‚Äôs new bill I call the Wet Kiss for Wall Street Act. 
All 3 of my brothers served in the military. I understand the sacrifice servicemembers make &amp; @DeptofDefense‚Äôs work to keep us safe.
Spoke w/ @ADMNeffenger to urge the @uscoastguard to drop its challenge of a MA oil spill prevention law. They agreed! 
Targeting people based on their religion flies squarely in the face of who we are as Americans ‚Äì and it makes our country less safe.
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
"A bill that kicks 22 million people off insurance to deliver $569 billion in tax giveaways to rich people is not a ""health care"" bill."
.@realDonaldTrump's @USTreasury pick Steve Mnuchin ran a bank infamous for aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosing on people‚Äôs homes.
The rules they'll water down reduce predatory lending &amp; make it less likely for mortgages to disintegrate in unsuspecting homeowners' hands.
The only thing that‚Äôs changed about Trumpcare is that @HouseGOP made the original plan even more brutal. #AHCA
Read my op-ed with @SenJackReed on student loans in @Politico today: 
I'm grateful for the workers who have been out there day &amp; night clearing roads &amp; working to restore power for people across MA #MAstorm
No one who works full time should live in poverty. Not fast food workers Uber drivers or hardworking folks at @BostonLogan. #Fightfor15
A SCOTUS fair housing case could continue the Court's assault on our core civil rights laws. Read my op-ed: 
"""Concentrated money &amp; concentrated power. They influence nearly every decision made in this town. But capture is not complete."" #CAPIdeas"
And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions ‚Äì who should have never been confirmed in the first place ‚Äì to resign. We need it now.
‚ÄúNo matter how much [@realDonaldTrump] might admire Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia here in America we will never accept autocracy.‚Äù #CAPIdeas
Giant corporations are squealing for tax cuts ‚Äì but they're not saying a word about the millions of people about to lose their health care.
Happy 50th anniversary Medicare &amp; Medicaid! #KeepingUSHealthy 
Consumer groups civil rights groups veterans groups ‚Äì everyone who‚Äôs not a big bank ‚Äì opposes the GOP #wrongchoiceact. 
@attn: Our newest episode of #PayingAttention w/ @MatthewESegal + @SenWarren is now live. WATCH:  
The @SenateGOP are also on the verge of reversing a @CFPB rule that helps you hold firms like @WellsFargo &amp; @Equifax accountable in court.
Appalled by #SCOTUS decision to gut Voting Rights Act. Congress must meet the challenge swiftly reverse this decision.
.@OfficeGovEthics wrote back with ‚Äúgreat concern‚Äù about the @SenateGOP‚Äôs confirmation hearings. 
We also got a ridiculous provision removed from the #CuresAct that would let drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors &amp; hospitals.
Let‚Äôs honor those who sacrificed for our country by strengthening our promises to servicemembers &amp; their families. 
@MassAGO: In Massachusetts equal means equal. TY @SenWarren for your unwavering support of #trans rights. #EveryoneWelcome 
What happens to grandma in a world where the Senate ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill passes? 
I‚Äôve introduced an amendment to stop trade deals with ISDS from using Fast Track legislation. Watch: 
.@HouseGOP Americans are fed up with a Washington that works great for giant companies but kicks hardworking people in the teeth.
Trump has delayed/weakened basic worker protections: overtime beryllium &amp; silica exposure mine safety EEOC data &amp; more. #LaborDay
America's biggest corporations have stashed over $2.6 trillion in profits offshore &amp; @realDonaldTrump wants to give them a tax cut.
Dem senators called on @usedgov to let FAFSA forms use earlier tax info. Happy @POTUS is changing this policy! 
If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic he‚Äôd deny ever hitting the iceberg.
Spoke today at #cunagac &amp; met with MA members. Member-owned credit unions are a model for financial institutions. 
Congress must step up &amp; refuse to reauthorize Section 702's surveillance program without significant new protections for Americans‚Äô privacy.
Today @usedgov has finally said enough is enough banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall.
@RepJoeKennedy: Joined @SenWarren @USRepKeating + @mayorflanagan to announce $1.25M grant for Fall River PD to hire 10 new officers. htt‚Ä¶

.@HouseAppropsGOP voted today to hamstring the @CFPB &amp; make it tougher for the cops on Wall Street to do their jobs.
I asked Chanin: Given his abysmal track record at the Fed why should anyone take him seriously? Watch: 
I‚Äôll continue to think about what I saw this week in Afghanistan &amp; incorporate it into my work on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Tomorrow @RepCummings &amp; I are hosting a student loan forum at UMass Boston. Share your own student loan story here: 
This is ridiculous. 233k people in MA receive Social Security disability benefits that could be threatened by these political games.
I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling but I know this: change must come. It must come now.
@RandPaul It‚Äôs long past time for Congress to do right by our troops &amp; the American people which is why I‚Äôm supporting @RandPaul‚Äôs AUMF amendment.

Any worker should be able to stay home when sick or care for a sick baby without going hungry. #itspersonal 
Let me be clear: It's foolish for any Dem to think that weakening support for the @CFPB is good for the country or good for us as a party.
#ff to my friend @SenFranken who has a brand-new office Twitter account. He's good enough smart enough &amp; doggone it people like him.
We must fight to stop corporate capture of federal courts &amp; ensure we have fair judges w/ diverse backgrounds @acslaw 
"Via @Upworthy: ""Watch @SenWarren go off on a banker who thinks taking advantage of struggling families isn't so bad"" "
.@realDonaldTrump wants to hand Steve Mnuchin the keys to @USTreasury ‚Äì where he can make big banks even richer at the expense of families.
It‚Äôs baffling that @USTreasury won‚Äôt act to protect hundreds of thousands of people. 
You already broke your promise @realDonaldTrump. You stacked your transition team with Wall Street elites insiders &amp; lobbyists.
Congress should pass our student loan servicer bill to ensure @usedgov never heads in the wrong direction again. 
Today we honor the victims &amp; survivors of the Marathon bombing with the 1st annual #OneBostonDay ‚Äì giving back through acts of service.
Trump &amp; the @SenateGOP‚Äôs latest trick: flout the precedent of consulting home-state senators on nominees to serve on courts in their states.
@SenatorReid: My new leadership team and I intend to make it crystal clear to the middle class that we‚Äôre fighting for them. 
Confirmation hearings historically aren‚Äôt conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.
Everyone who is serious about standing up for borrowers with #studentdebt should embrace these fundamentals. Watch: 
I‚Äôm not giving up on all the Americans who need unemployment insurance ‚Äì watch my interview with @AlexWagner today: 
@MassEMA: Our Massachusetts Alerts app has location specific weather warnings &amp; alerts:  #MAsnow 
We know @WellsFargo‚Äôs Board knew of exec Carrie Tolstedt‚Äôs misconduct but she‚Äôll still retire with a huge payout:

Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country‚Äôs opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.
Alexis is working on her BA in math &amp; wants to become a public school teacher but she‚Äôs already taken on over $50000 in debt. #InTheRed
Americans want tougher rules &amp; more accountability on Wall Street ‚Äì not the GOP‚Äôs #bailoutbudget. 
"""Our country is in trouble: Degrees push us forward but debt holds us back."" #affordablecollege "
Now @realDonaldTrump is about to surrender U.S. climate leadership on the world stage by pulling out of the Paris Agreement.
It is outrageous that @realDonaldTrump is making veiled threats to withdraw relief workers from US citizens in need. That's poor leadership.
Glad that @SecAF23 could join us at Hanscom AF Base today to discuss the important work happening here in MA. 
‚ÄúFinally just like colleges and states the federal government should step up too.‚Äù #affordablecollege
The @CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays and no carve-outs.
A bank cashier who steals $20 would be facing theft charges but Wall St execs never hold themselves accountable. Not in 2008 &amp; not now.
I‚Äôm glad @JohnKingatED held firm &amp; finally pulled the plug on for-profit college accreditor ACICS. 
Most retirement advisers do what‚Äôs in their clients‚Äô best interests but not all of them. #SaveYourSavings
Not once has Congress failed to authorize CHIP which funds health care for kids. Except this year - when @SenateGOP is in control. 
Navient one of the biggest student loan servicers got caught cheating American soldiers on student loans. #studentdebt
‚ÄúFor every dollar invested in the NIH we get about $2.20 back.‚Äù #weallneedscience
The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders ‚Äì violating Dodd-Frank.
There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
Opioid treatment centers like High Point rely on Medicaid. Recent threats put their patients at risk. We need to expand ‚Äì not cut ‚Äì funding.
This is the same cruel Trumpcare bill that @HouseGOP tried to pass weeks ago. Still strips coverage from millions &amp; guts Medicaid. #AHCA
For seniors &amp; vets living on Social Security an extra $581 next year from the #SAVEBenefits Act would mean a lot. 
To the credit reporting industry people aren‚Äôt their customers. We‚Äôre just their products. We need to reform this broken industry. 
If we're going to stop climate change we must look at Citizens United. Watch my colleague @SenWhitehouse's speech: 
Tune in here to watch AG Jeff Sessions' live testimony before the Senate Intel Committee:  #SessionsHearing
If we want strong enforcement personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen‚Äôs call for tougher Wall St enforcement: 
Glad to meet with presidents &amp; trustees of MA community colleges to discuss ways the fed gov can support our schools &amp; invest in students. 
.@HouseGOP Watch @SenDuckworth @SenBillNelson @SenatorTester &amp; @SenBlumenthal explain: we owe it to vets to stop Trumpcare. 
Children deserve a lot more than the Republicans' 2-year CHIP patch. I support the 4-year plan to #ExtendCHIP now. Our kids need it.
Watch @RepCummings &amp; me on @Morning_Joe this morning talking about our new Middle Class Prosperity Project: 
I‚Äôm cosponsoring @CoryBooker‚Äôs bill so the fed gov can't engage in surveillance or harassment of immigrant groups. 
There are a lot of words that a President could use to describe their healthcare plan. Effective. Efficient. Comprehensive. Compassionate.
The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators.
I've asked @TheJusticeDept to investigate its inability to prosecute the FCIC's referrals.  
None of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs actions today will make us safer. They‚Äôll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.
Steve Mnuchin &amp; OneWest Bank swooped in after the 2008 crash &amp; aggressively ‚Äì &amp; sometimes illegally ‚Äì foreclosed on people‚Äôs homes.
We can build a stronger more united America. And we can start right now.  #filibuster #holdthefloor
Step up &amp; do your job @realDonaldTrump. Stop lying about how well things are going in Puerto Rico. Stop trying to avoid responsibility.
It's time for the @FCC to do the right thing and adopt @BarackObama's #NetNeutrality plan as soon as possible.
Today is 5yrs since the last federal min wage raise went into effect. Full time workers shouldn't be in poverty‚Äîlet‚Äôs #RaiseTheWage #1010now
Students in MA &amp; across the country are getting crushed by debt ‚Äì and Congress needs to do something. #bankonstudents 
Wall St‚Äôs bets brought our economy to its knees - &amp; today the big banks are bigger than when they were declared ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù 7 yrs ago.
They're trying to tack rollbacks on leg like the funding bill Congress must pass next wk to prevent a gov shutdown. It's cynical &amp; corrupt.
When tax dodgers move back to the US they should pay their fair share ‚Äì just as working families &amp; small businesses have been all along.
Rex Tillerson lobbied against the rule for @exxonmobil to disclose payments to foreign govs because it hurt their business with Russia.
The game is rigged when people pay higher taxes working for money than inheriting it. I support @barackobama's plan: 
Holy guacamole we had 1300 people at our Martha's Vineyard town hall this morning! This is what democracy looks like. Thank you for coming! 
I‚Äôve introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen. Rubio to help cut off human traffickers‚Äô access to the banking system: 
Rep Tom Price - @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs pick to run @HHSgov - is the lead architect of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
We need to pass #BankOnStudents so kids can refinance student debt &amp; have a #fairshot at an education #TBT 
Congress must provide effective support &amp; oversight of the Armed Forces monitor ntl security threats &amp; ensure responsible use of force.
Today I‚Äôm launching #DeVosWatch a new oversight effort to hold @BetsyDeVosEd &amp; @usedgov accountable. Watch: 
Student loans make it tough for ppl to buy homes. Thrilled @nardotrealtor supports my #bankonstudents refi bill. 
Yup that‚Äôs right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG‚Äôs ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.
Another sign the bipartisan chorus is growing to make sure Wall Street fund managers pay their fair share: 
MA has led the nation in protecting &amp; promoting #LGBT equality. Let's continue to lead by supporting full #trans equality in MA.
I asked leading financial firms about @USDOL's rule. They told me: it‚Äôs good for families &amp; they‚Äôre ready to comply: 
Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
Workers w/o employers have a challenge paying into Social Security ‚Äì affecting disability &amp; retirement. #itspersonal 
If Congress won't stand up for workers the very least we can do is give these workers a chance to join together &amp; stand up for themselves.
The President of the United States just defended neo-Nazis and blamed those who condemn their racism and hate. This is sick.
I met with Pakistan Army Chief Gen. Bajwa to discuss the critical role Pakistan must play in countering terrorism in the region. 
Nothing can take the place of seeing what is happening in the region with our own eyes &amp; speaking to the men &amp; women on the ground. 
"After slamming leaks as ""criminal"" Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him."
We‚Äôre going to vote tonight on a @SenateGOP proposal that makes it harder to hold @WellsFargo &amp; @Equifax accountable. It's nuts but true.
Too often gov works for those who can hire armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists. But not always. #SaveYourSavings
@RepTierney: I introduced a bill today with @SenWarren and @askgeorge to allow existing student loan borrowers to refinance 
I support @SenBlumenthal‚Äôs Background Check Completion Act. It's time to fix our broken gun background check system. 
Great visit today‚Äì thanks for all you do for MA &amp; U.S. MT @TheNationsFirst @SenWarren during a visit at @Hanscom_AFB 
50 yrs after the #EqualPay Act the fight continues for equal pay for equal work. Read my op-ed on @masslivenews: 
Under Trumpcare 445k MA residents would lose healthcare. We‚Äôd lose $10B in state funding. And out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket.
@MassAGO: Betsy DeVos and the billion-dollar for-profit school industry want to cancel student protections. With 18 fellow AG's I'm fig‚Ä¶
Ben Bernanke of the @federalreserve will testify before the Banking Committee at 10am. Watch live at 
This is your moment in history @SenateGOP. You can side with a political party or the people you represent. Prove we're better than this.
We‚Äôll gear up &amp; fight back like we‚Äôve done so many times before. We won‚Äôt let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends.
One witness at a forum called himself a frog in warm water ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt know he was being cooked until too late. #SaveYourSavings
If PR were a country it could go to the IMF. If it were a city it could declare bankruptcy. It can do neither because of Congress.
Despite all the drama of the Trump Admin there's one thing they‚Äôve carried out with complete precision: An all-out assault on US workers.
The proposed payday lending rule isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äì it could do more ‚Äì but the payday industry is already firing back.
.@HouseGOP @RepHensarling The @CFPB forced banks to return $12B to consumers they cheated. But @RepHensarling says Wall Street HATES his plan to kill CFPB. What?!
The Trump Admin &amp; @SenateGOP socked it to workers one more time before the summer recess: Confirming an anti-worker nominee to @NLRB.
Not one of the people or corporations referred to @TheJusticeDept by the FCIC has been criminally prosecuted. That‚Äôs an abysmal failure.
As Mueller steps up to enforce the law Congress must step up too ‚Äì with its own independent bipartisan &amp; transparent investigations.
The GOP Trumpcare plan is as clear as it is cruel: destroy health care for tens of millions in order to give tax cuts to rich people.
Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch: 
@realDonaldTrump @FCC Powerful companies shouldn‚Äôt decide how or when we use the internet. That‚Äôs why we have to fight back to defend #NetNeutrality.
I'm very pleased to be joining the @SenateEnergy Committee. It plays an important role in shaping our energy &amp; natural resources policies.
.@realDonaldTrump just paid $25 million for breaking the law &amp; ripping off students. 
If @WellsFargo‚Äôs John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions that's still not real accountability.
The gov‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt make billions of $$ in profit off our students we should invest in our future. #DontDoubleMyRate
Last month I traveled to Europe to see the Syrian refugee crisis up close. Today I spoke about what I saw: 
.@usedgov didn‚Äôt fall for the scheme. To other shady #4profit schools @JohnKingatED's right: Don‚Äôt waste your time. 
Trump‚Äôs cabinet of billionaires &amp; CEOs have ignored gov ethics rules &amp; dragged their feet on FBI background checks &amp; financial disclosures.
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
Estonia has learned a lot about orchestrated cyber-attacks. Their expertise is critical to deter &amp; defend against Russian cyber-operations. 
Subjecting Dreamers to mass deportation is part of the bigoted policies that are a cornerstone of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs admin. #DefendDACA
Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
Today I joined fellow Democratic senators in calling for an appropriations bill immediately to help the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI. 
Congress must do more to reform higher ed accreditation so I introduced a bill w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenBrianSchatz:

"If @RepMickMulvaney thinks the @CFPB is a ""sad sick joke"" maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituents"
Payday lending is a $7B/yr industry. That buys a lot of influence in Congress ‚Äì not just with the GOP but also some Democrats.
I appreciate @RepJohnConyers' leadership on this letter and his long record of leadership on civil rights and diversity issues.
We can make it harder for terrorism to take root in our country. We can drive forces of hate out of our nation. #filibuster #holdthefloor
The @CFPB‚Äôs investigation of @WellsFargo uncovered staggering workplace conditions imposed on employees to meet sales quotas.
Today I sent a letter to Chair Mary Jo White requesting info on my serious concerns w/ the SEC's record: 
Honored to speak at the @UMassAmherst graduation ceremony this afternoon! #umass2017 
I'm pleased @Energy took a big step toward developing clean wind energy off the MA coast 
For the @GOP states‚Äô rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women‚Äôs bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud.
Here‚Äôs the deal: Innovations improve our lives &amp; create new wealth. But policy will determine if workers share in that wealth. #itspersonal
@MarkeyMemo: .@SenWarren Proud to partner with you for Massachusetts and the entire country! 
The GOP‚Äôs values aren‚Äôt America‚Äôs values. I‚Äôm standing up for our values by voting against this terrible budget. 
Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer &amp; @SenWhitehouse opposing SS trustee nominee Blahous &amp; SEC nominee Peirce: 
Under Dodd-Frank Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC ‚Äì an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.
But here we go again - Republicans are threatening to shut down the gov in days unless we ban disclosure of corporate political spending.
There‚Äôs no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
The federal government must move quickly &amp; do whatever is needed to help Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands recover from Maria &amp; Irma.
Thanks @POTUS &amp; @DHSgov for reaffirming US values by ending the xenophobic NSEERS program. We're better than that. 
.@TheJusticeDept NYT says Comey asked Rosenstein for more resources for Russia investigation ‚Äì right before firing. DOJ denies. 
In just a few minutes I‚Äôll be speaking at the Finance &amp; Society #NewThinkingDC conference. Watch live: 
The nightmare is over at least for now.
"""There are many things @NewtGingrich &amp; I disagree on but we strongly agree investment in research is a responsibility of elected leaders."""
Unbelievable. @WellsFargo's massive fraud is even worse than we thought. 
Settlements may be tax deductible or have credits hidden in fine print. If the gov is going to cut deals we should know what we‚Äôre getting.
A lack of diverse leadership is hurting the @FederalReserve‚Äôs policy decision-making process. 
Last night the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban so Trump fired her.
Aggressive negotiations can yield good results ‚Äì including $100 million to fight the opioid epidemic. 
I just got off the phone with Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz. I told her to keep up her heroic work &amp; leadership on behalf of Puerto Rico.

Within days of taking office @realDonaldTrump ordered @HHSGov officials to cancel ads encouraging people to sign up for ACA coverage.
I took @SenateGOP's deal: 2 other judges confirmed if I‚Äôd keep quiet. Then today I went back to the floor to call for votes on the 15.
.@usedgov secretaries have served as teachers school system leaders governors ‚Äì and Betsy DeVos has held no such position.
I'm reading the latest way that Senate Republicans plan to rip health care away from millions of people. I'll share my thoughts soon. 
Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

Just got out of a Banking Committee hearing. Reading the @SenateGOP healthcare bill for the first time now. I'll share my thoughts soon. 
I explained my concerns about Tom Price‚Äôs @HHSgov nomination in a 20-page letter yesterday. 
At the same time they‚Äôre blocking any SCOTUS nominee @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.
Wow 1100 people jammed Furnace Brook Middle School for our Marshfield town hall tonight! Thank you all for joining us! 
Our office joined the #PinkOut to #StandWithPP. We won't let the GOP shut down the gov to defund women's healthcare. 
This isn‚Äôt football. It‚Äôs not about scoring points. #AHCA will devastate Americans‚Äô healthcare. Families will go bankrupt. People will die.
In June we sent a letter to @BetsyDeVosED with concerns that a single servicer would make an unaccountable monopoly.

I‚Äôm deeply relieved that @SenateMajLdr delayed a vote on the @SenateGOP's bill to rip health care away from 22 million Americans.
The @SenateGOP health care bill released today is the worst one yet: 
Senate GOP plans to use another spending bill to gut the @CFPB. 1st vote could be tomorrow - spread the word NOW. 
FEMA's Puerto Rico plans are outdated &amp; are outpaced by charities. Distribution is woefully inadequate &amp; people need basic medical care now.
Congrats to @fstockman &amp; @jrinaldi5 on your @BostonGlobe Pulitzer Prizes! All of MA is grateful for your fantastic work. #Pulitzer100
‚ÄúPell Grant funding should be mandatory rather than subject to yearly discretionary budget fights.‚Äù 
Today @TomCoburn &amp; I introduced the #TruthinSettlements Act to increase transparency around gov't settlements: 
There‚Äôs a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.
Congress needs to step up &amp; pass comprehensive immigration reform. Until then we must #defendDACA &amp; protect hard-working young immigrants.
Glad to have @JosephEStiglitz in our office this afternoon to discuss the @rooseveltinst #rewritetherules agenda. 
I‚Äôm proud to #Fightfor15 alongside workers in Massachusetts &amp; nationwide. #povertydoesntfly 
Today I told regulators: the public deserves information about banks that illegally foreclosed on families. Watch: 
We had a financial crisis when powerful people in government let big banks run wild. @realDonaldTrump wants to take us back down that road.
Happy #LaborDay! Today we say loud &amp; clear: Unions built America's middle class &amp; unions will rebuild America's middle class. 
Breaking: @SenateGOP to vote tomorrow to take away your legal rights against companies like @Equifax &amp; @WellsFargo. Here's what's at stake. 
And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies.
I stopped in Wiesbaden Germany on my way back from Poland &amp; Estonia at the headquarters for US Army operations in Europe. 
Our GI Bill legislation gives better Yellow Ribbon benefits for fallen servicemembers‚Äô families &amp; increased coverage for some reservists.
.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities.
@MassGovernor: Signed an Executive Order banning vehicles on the road effective at 4pm today. #mastorm
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
I sat down with @Buzzfeed to discuss ISDS ‚Äì a rigged court system baked into our trade deals including the #TPP: 
In the wake of powerful hurricanes Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands face an urgent humanitarian crisis. Congress must address it NOW.
In fact #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans Pell Grants or public education at all.
I‚Äôm also glad that two Coast Guard helicopters a plane &amp; crew from Cape Cod are already helping with Hurricane #Harvey rescue efforts.
With working families across the country scraping to make ends meet Congress should strengthen protections for workers - not gut them.
Ashamed &amp; disgusted that the Senate works for the @NRA &amp; not the majority of Americans who support basic solutions to stop gun violence.
This is good news. At least for now @realDonaldTrump &amp; AG Sessions can‚Äôt bludgeon towns into complying with dumb &amp; dangerous ICE policies. 
Jessica Kensky &amp; Patrick Downes survived the Boston Marathon bombing. @DeptofDefense gave them special designation for care at Walter Reed.
@marty_walsh: Today I announced a new effort to reduce violence in our #Boston community. These guns have no place in our streets: 
Today I asked Ben Bernanke: Why isn't Wall St paying for its free insurance from taxpayers? 
But let‚Äôs get real: Most of the big banks are even bigger now than when we declared them ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù in 2008 &amp; bailed them out.
"""Now is the time to remind @realDonaldTrump that our gov is not a plaything to make him richer or a servant to do his bidding."" #CAPIdeas"
We don‚Äôt need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.
We need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they don‚Äôt like.
Today @MassAGO Healey is leading 18 states in a lawsuit to force @BetsyDeVosED to follow the law &amp; cancel the loans of cheated students.
We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom a country made strong by diversity.
The @CFTC committee‚Äôs report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.

.@WellsFargo is a mess. On top of its fake accounts it charged almost 1M people for car insurance they didn't want. 
.@realDonaldTrump - do your job. 
Women aren‚Äôt fools. We know the difference between reality &amp; lies. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre fighting back to stop the @SenateGOP healthcare bill.

Fmr Rep @anthonyweiner didn‚Äôt like that I called out @RepEricCantor for his new Wall St job. Let's look at the facts: 
It is totally unprecedented for a President-elect of the United States to have to settle fraud lawsuits before taking office.
Always enjoy learning more about the groundbreaking research that goes on in MA - like at @MBLScience in Woods Hole 
Just minutes after taking the oath of office @POTUS Trump made it harder for working families to get a mortgage. 
@middlesex_cc: Thank you @SenWarren for taking the time to speak with students today. 
"Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a ""university"" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme."
From what I can tell ‚Äúskinny repeal‚Äù just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act.
Is this some sort of sick joke @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus ‚Äî and our country‚Äôs response to this emergency ‚Äî just a game to you?!
After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.
#EqualPayDay isn‚Äôt a national day of celebration. It‚Äôs a national day of embarrassment.
The Kochs‚Äô purpose is clear: To tilt the game further for corporate special interests. It‚Äôs up to us to fight back.
Thank you to all our veterans for your service. We are grateful for your courage your dedication &amp; your sacrifice.

In the choice between students &amp; student loan companies Betsy DeVos made clear she stands with companies that cheat &amp; squeeze borrowers.
A group of Massachusetts women came by the Senate to fight back against Trumpcare ‚Äì and they inspire me to keep fighting too. 
The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a right-wing attack on women‚Äôs rights. Watch why I voted to #StandwithPP: 
Instead of siding with the big banks the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat.
A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.
Americans don‚Äôt deserve political stalemate that will end not in more government or less government but just in bad government #EndGridlock
Gov is supposed to work for all of us. But when it comes to making sure courts &amp; watchdogs are staffed @SenateGOP refuse to do their jobs.
When these OT changes take effect in December millions will have a fighting chance to build more financial security. That‚Äôs a big deal!

Today I voted for #ESSA the ESEA reauthorization bill to replace No Child Left Behind. Watch me explain why: 
It‚Äôs time to take our gov back from special interests &amp; put it where it belongs: in the hands of #WethePeople. 
The GOP will be responsible for every 5-4 decision that throws working Americans under the bus to favor the powerful moneyed few.
I‚Äôm glad the Senate passed our bipartisan Jobs for Heroes Act yesterday. I hope the House will pass it soon. 
Let me be clear: If Trump doesn‚Äôt keep his word &amp; Congress doesn‚Äôt pass a clean Dream Act I won‚Äôt vote for a spending bill without it.

Today a new GOP Senate must decide whether self-interest &amp; political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right.
At 10 years old Liam wrote a letter to @realDonaldTrump about his mom‚Äôs fragile health. Liam‚Äôs voice is definitely one we need to hear: 
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
GOP &amp; Dem governors have urged Congress to keep our promise to families &amp; hold down health insurance premiums. We should listen to them.
Accreditors shouldn't be able to certify schools then walk away when the schools defraud students w/ useless degrees

Today @HouseGOP are voting to make it legal for employers to cheat workers out of overtime. It's a disgrace. 
Chairman @ChuckGrassley should reject @SenateMajLdr‚Äôs dangerous proposal to end blue slips &amp; stand up for fair courts &amp; equal justice.
@SenSanders: New on the podcast: Bernie and @SenWarren take questions about the disastrous Republican health care plan: 
It‚Äôs another good day: The @CFPB just took a big step to protect consumers from predatory payday loans. 
We need to rebuild the wall between boring commercial banking ‚Äì checking &amp; savings accounts - &amp; riskier investment banking.
We need to allow military doctors to share their expertise &amp; provide terrorism victims with streamlined access to our military healthcare.
The test of a @USDOL nominee is simple: will you stand up for 150 million US workers? Acosta failed this basic test. 
But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses dragging its feet on key rules

.@SenateMajLdr says he'll get the votes he needs to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It‚Äôs still up to us.
Today I‚Äôm introducing the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act w/ @SenJohnMcCain @CantwellPress &amp; @SenAngusKing: 
And the GOP tax plan will explode the deficit which will lead the GOP to say we need to gut Medicaid Medicare infrastructure &amp; education.
Thank you @RepStephenLynch &amp; @SenMarkey for your leadership &amp; Rolling Thunder for your hard work to get our POW/MIA bill passed &amp; signed.
@US_GSAR1: .@SenWarren visits with attendees during Mass Business Matchmaker this morning at Roxbury CC. 
@marty_walsh: To our first responders across the City a most sincere thank you on behalf of the people of Boston. #OneBostonDay 
I‚Äôm speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination. 
At Tuesday's Banking Committee I asked the regulators: How many Wall St execs have you recommended for prosecution?  
Today @usedgov announced it will reverse its single loan servicer plan ‚Äì &amp; I‚Äôm glad that they‚Äôre changing course. 
Stalemates don't end in more or less govt but bad govt. After 2 years it's time for the Senate to give Rich Cordray a vote. #cfpb
A new report shows that 70 Massachusetts workers ‚Äî from ages 18-74 ‚Äî lost their lives on the job in 2016 alone: 
Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St‚Äôs influence.
Thanks @SenatorBegich @MarkeyMemo @RepTierney @USRepKeating &amp; industry reps for a productive session on NE fishing issues &amp; reforming MSA
if you agree: Our gov't shouldn‚Äôt be making billions of dollars by drowning our students in debt #BankonStudents 
Millions of Americans of all parties think Washington is rigged against them. Tonight‚Äôs vote is Exhibit A. 
Now's the time to let people refinance their student loans. Thank you @WhiteHouse for supporting our #BankOnStudents bill. #SOTU
Tonight I'll be talking to Rachel @Maddow about today's @SenateBanking hearing with @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf. Tune in at 9PM ET!
@ACLU_Mass: We encourage anyone being detained at Logan under #MuslimBan as well as their families/friends to contact us at 617-482-31‚Ä¶
I introduced the #BankOnStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to help our economy &amp; give grads a #fairshot. Watch: 
Shareholders should vote out every member of the @WellsFargo‚Äôs board who was around during this scam. This is about accountability.
The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.
‚ÄúBut that so-called choice gets it wrong. Rules are not the enemy of markets. Rules are a necessary ingredient for healthy markets.‚Äù
Judge Merrick Garland has served his country with distinction ‚Äì as a prosecutor DOJ official &amp; DC Circuit judge. #SCOTUSnominee
Tune in here to watch the Senate floor live as @SenateDems #holdthefloor to fight Trumpcare:  #ShowUsTheBill
Andrew Puzder looks down on working people. At @Hardees &amp; @CarlsJr he got rich squeezing front-line workers on wages overtime &amp; benefits.
This Congress doesn‚Äôt lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.
Protecting waterways should be a bipartisan issue. We can‚Äôt let the GOP block the @EPA‚Äôs rule.   #ProtectCleanWater
Standardized testing has gone too far in many places. I support the @WhiteHouse‚Äôs call to limit overburdensome tests 
The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount 
The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
That‚Äôs the @GOP agenda in a nutshell: Pay Congress to do nothing &amp; block back-breaking Americans from getting paid for a hard day‚Äôs work.
My colleagues &amp; I will host a forum today at 3pm to hear from @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees employees. I hope you‚Äôll tune in. 
There is no precedent for a @usedgov secretary with the lack of experience in public education that Betsy DeVos has.
@BostonGlobe: @mlevenson: Gov. Patrick has declared a state of emergency effective at noon today. Allows him to call up National G ...
While the GOP plan slashes the income tax rate for the highest earners it increases the tax rate that applies to many working families.
On my way to @Recode's Code Conference! Follow our conversation tonight at #codeconf or on their website at 
We recognize #EqualPayDay - &amp; we fight so we don‚Äôt have to recognize it again. Watch: 
It‚Äôs also not real accountability if the guy @Equifax promoted to Chair is a board member who served on the data security committee.
@SenatorReid: This @Buzzfeed take on my life is entertaining. I remember that match it was my first KO. 
Investments in education &amp; training are a key part of growing our economy &amp; helping families build a future &amp; Boston is leading the way.
Memorial Day is a time to honor the sacrifices our servicemembers make to protect our families. Watch my message: 
@MassEMA: Tornado Warning for parts of Bristol Norfolk and Worcester Counties until 6PM  #alert 
Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts.
Also introduced a bipartisan bill w/ @SenRubioPress honoring POW &amp; MIA servicemembers w/ a permanent commemorative chair at the Capitol.
It‚Äôs time for the @SenateGOP to drop this ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill for good ‚Äì and do it immediately.
Today on #WomensEqualityDay we celebrate the courageous women who fought for suffrage &amp; continue fighting to protect women‚Äôs rights
@MassEMA: Tornado Warning for parts of Central Plymouth County until 7:00 PM #alert 
Title X is a bipartisan program to provide birth control cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests &amp; @VP Pence cast the tiebreaking vote attacking it
The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.
I worked w/ @RoyBlunt @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenatorLankford on a bill to stop @usedgov‚Äôs terrible loan servicer plan. 
I was proud to vote for comprehensive #immigration reform in the Senate but House Republicans have refused a vote for over a year.
5000 low-level @WellsFargo employees got fired. Not 1 Board member did. That's our screwed up corporate accountability system in a nutshell.
There‚Äôs nothing in Steve Mnuchin‚Äôs record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street ‚Äì or that he‚Äôd even want to stand up to Wall Street.
@mayortommenino: @SenWarren and I @The_BMC this morning to highlight dangers of NIH research funding cuts. 
@Equifax The credit reporting industry is broken and has been taking advantage of consumers for years. Time to do something about it.
The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real independent transparent inquiry.
In South Waziristan Army &amp; local leaders showed us how USAID's development projects are making a real difference in people's lives. 
Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that ‚Äì empty talk.
Today @SenatorLankford &amp; I reintroduced our #TruthinSettlements Act to shut down the backroom deal making: 
I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration‚Äôs disturbing relationship with Russia.
The fiduciary rule is working for consumers start-ups and big investment companies. So why is the Chamber of Commerce trying to kill it? 
Now it‚Äôs time to focus on helping @ITTTech students ‚Äì the real victims ‚Äì get their loans cancelled or finish programs at schools that care.
@rosadelauro: Fast-tracking TPP is only going to hurt the ability of hardworking Americans to get and keep good-paying jobs #StopFastTra‚Ä¶
.@SenFranken and I need your help to stop Congress from giving away your right to hold big banks accountable. Watch: 
3 hours before the Mnuchin victims‚Äô forum was scheduled to start @SenRonJohnson finally agreed that we could use his empty hearing room.
Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia serious business conflicts &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes.
Last wk I visited the High Point Treatment Center in Plymouth a treatment facility on the front lines of the opioid epidemic. #EndOverdose 
Had a delicious lunch at T.K.O. Malley's in Scituate today!
My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. 
.@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
.@HouseGOP aren‚Äôt waiting for @realDonaldTrump to roll back Wall St reform. HR 6392 guts Dodd-Frank rules for 30 of the biggest banks.
I was disappointed but not surprised that some Sen Republicans objected to a Truth in Settlements Act vote Tuesday: 
I support the #ClayHunt Act to strengthen mental health &amp; suicide prevention services for our veterans. 
Congratulations to my new colleague @SenMoCowan! He's going to do a great job fighting for MA families in the Senate.
GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
Today we honored Watertown officers w/ Congressional Badges of Bravery for heroic acts after the 2013 Boston Marathon 
Terrorists must have no place to run &amp; hide but we must also remember that terrorists commit acts of violence to paralyze &amp; divide us.
Disappointed by the TPA vote. I hope the House will carefully scrutinize this deal &amp; demand TPP be made public before a Fast Track vote.
You‚Äôd think the @SenateGOP would be ready to work right? Nope. They‚Äôre getting ready for ANOTHER break. #DoYourJob 
#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
.@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate.
The GOP budgets weaken the rules on Wall St. We know what they're up to &amp; we're watching:  #bailoutbudget
The banks cut loose by HR 6392 are the same size as the banks that helped bring down the economy in 2008. What could possibly go wrong?!
I‚Äôve also asked the @FBI to release its investigation materials related to FCIC referrals.  
I support @barackobama‚Äôs decision on #ImmigrationAction. If House Republicans won‚Äôt do their jobs it‚Äôs time for the President to do his.
About to speak on the Senate floor about why we can't allow the @SenateGOP to repeal the ACA. Watch live: 
So here‚Äôs the deal: In the dead of night tonight the @SenateGOP will try to pass a ‚Äúskinny repeal‚Äù of health care.
It‚Äôs time to end unfair scheduling practices that hurt workers &amp; families. Watch:   #SchedulesThatWork
Yesterday was 2 yrs since @CFPB opened its doors &amp; it‚Äôs already making a difference. We have a strong agency fighting for American families
I intro'd the College Transparency Act w/ @senorrinhatch Bill Cassidy &amp; @SenWhitehouse to patch college data gaps: 
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision reducing the admin burden at NIH to ensure more efficient spending of fed research money.
Responsible nations stick to their agreements. Responsible Presidents put America's safety first. If this President won't Congress must.
When General Nicholson our Commanding General in Afghanistan visited me in DC I told him I'd like to return the favor. 
.@RepKClark &amp; I toured the Framingham Community Outpatient Clinic today &amp; held a roundtable on veterans' issues. 
With every day that passes I‚Äôm more outraged that the federal govt isn‚Äôt doing more to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI.
.@POTUS Trump is reinstating the ‚Äúglobal gag rule‚Äù to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.
We hand out tax breaks to big corps but millions of working families will be plunged into poverty if we don‚Äôt extend their tax breaks too.
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision to strengthen Senator Kennedy‚Äôs work to protect the genetic privacy of patients.
"""I know [@JohnKerry] believes through &amp; through in the good that America can do in the world because he's seen it &amp; lived it all his life."""
Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.
We must have the @CFPB's back as Wall St's buddies in Congress try to roll back the rules. But today: we celebrate. Happy Birthday @CFPB!
Too often lawyers &amp; lobbyists bury the voices of American workers. It‚Äôs time to listen to workers who need a fighting chance. #overdueOT
It‚Äôs time to #RaiseTheWage honor working families &amp; end corporate welfare for companies paying poverty-level wages: 
@SenBobCasey: I'm with @SenWarren. The #BankOnStudents Emergency Loan Refinancing Act could help nearly 1.2 mil Pennsylvanians. 
Thanks @SenMarkey @SenBillNelson @maziehirono @SenSchumer @SenatorLeahy @SenWhitehouse @alfranken for speaking out on the #SAVEBenefits Act!
Watch my remarks to the HELP Committee today on why Congress needs to commit to funding medical research: 
.@realdonaldtrump's budget would impose deep cuts to opioid crisis funding. We can't let this budget be the final word. 
8 years ago today Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy &amp; millions of people suffered for it.
I‚Äôm heartsick for the victims of last night‚Äôs massacre in Las Vegas &amp; their loved ones.
We should never cower to fear by turning against our neighbors or by rejecting our values.
@SenatorBarb: Adjustment in 2016 Social Security for seniors will go a long way when it comes to visits to putting food on the table or ‚Ä¶
As Russia engages in aggressive destabilizing activity in the region it's important for allies like Poland to know the US has their backs. 
The GOP is inventing a Social Security crisis that will threaten benefits for millions &amp; put our most vulnerable at risk.
My bill directs the IRS to develop a free online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.
Heather McCreary lost her home when Mnuchin‚Äôs bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. 
How do @SenateGOP expect us to talk about prescription costs when they‚Äôre secretly writing a plan to throw millions off their health care?! 
Very glad to see @RepMcGovern @RepKClark @RepJoeKennedy &amp; @sethmoulton all joining the #NoBillNoBreak fight. #holdthefloor #goodtrouble
Registering &amp; tracking Americans based on race or religion is idiotic. Disgusting. Unconstitutional. And it‚Äôs a recruiting bonanza for ISIS.
The Fed can remove @WellsFargo Board members for their role in the fake accounts scam. Yesterday I asked the Fed Chair: why won't you do it? 
Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.
‚ÄúThis is simple math: As states cut back their support tuition goes up &amp; families pick up the bill.‚Äù 
.@realDonaldTrump should pick a new @HHSGov Sec who cares less about luxury travel &amp; ripping away health care &amp; more about families' health.
The Boston Harbor Dredging Project will create jobs improve the passage of goods &amp; improve Boston's long-term economic competitiveness. 
It‚Äôs time for Congress to stop just talking about increasing NIH funding &amp; start doing something about it. Watch: 
"Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP ""health care"" bill IS Trumpcare &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans."
Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
And now there‚Äôs talk that the Special Counsel now running the Russia investigation may be next on the chopping block. That‚Äôs bananas.
Every major party Presidential candidate should release their tax returns. And they all do ‚Äì except @realDonaldTrump. He's just too chicken.
Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts or they‚Äôd pull out of more state health care exchanges.
Any conversation about tackling poverty in the US should include protecting &amp; expanding Social Security.
@CFPB: One way we accomplish our mission is by enforcing consumer protection laws #4Years4You  
@SenSanders: I had the pleasure of sitting down with my good friend @SenWarren to discuss the secret Republican health care plan. 
Citigroup is holding government funding hostage to ram through its government bailout provision. Join me in opposing the #CitigroupShutdown
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
I'm proud of all the men &amp; women in uniform from Massachusetts who are helping with efforts in Houston. 
There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
About to join @SenateDems on the floor to fight for CHIP. Children‚Äôs health doesn‚Äôt belong on the backburner. Watch: 
In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters.
After a meeting with the @SenateGOP it turns out @realDonaldTrump is willing to abandon Dreamers after all. 
.@wesoldieron is an incredible organization fighting to end veteran homelessness. Very glad to visit their women's program in Leeds today. 
I‚Äôll fight back as Republicans try to gut access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment by repealing ACA &amp; cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
.@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisors‚Äô wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule 
.@CoryBooker And count dollars not just pennies. Find ways to save on big-ticket budget items like rent &amp; transportation. #SaveYourSavings
"""No matter how high tuition rises &amp; how poor the outcomes ‚Äì most schools face no consequences for failing students or for wasting fed aid."""
We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far I‚Äôve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.
That means Corinthian‚Äôs victims eligible for loan forgiveness are instead having tax refunds EITC &amp; Social Security garnished. It‚Äôs absurd.
Let‚Äôs be clear: No organization that represents actual human beings wants the @SenateGOP to reverse the @CFPB‚Äôs arbitration rule.
We all know @Navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. 
Back in DC but still thinking about my trip to Afghanistan. The Administration owes our troops a definition of victory &amp; plan to get there. 
‚ÄúI've called for doubling the NIH budget.‚Äù -@NewtGingrich #weallneedscience 
But @realDonaldTrump is right: The GOP healthcare bill IS mean. Cutting healthcare for 23M people to give billionaires a tax break is mean.
I raised my many concerns about @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos in a 16-page letter to her last week. 
I #StandWithPP because millions of women in MA &amp; across this country depend on Planned Parenthood for basic medical care. #PinkOut 
Thank you to the brave first responders and volunteers for their heroic actions during the tragedy in Boston

I love speaking at MA graduations. Watch highlights from @umassamherst. 
@DrugPolicyOrg: BIG thanks @SenWarren @CoryBooker @SenSanders for joining 1000+ others urging UN to end the drug war. 
I told my Dem colleagues: We weren‚Äôt sent to Congress to roll over to drug companies. Show some spine &amp; fight back. 
Holly Petraeus (@CFPBMilitary) @nikiinthehouse @coleynee (@MASSDVS) &amp; I met #vets &amp; #milfam in Boston Lowell today 
@OversightDems: Tell @SenWarren and @RepCummings why you believe your retirement savings shouldbe protected 
Every day I get more &amp; more calls from people across MA who are desperately worried about the people they love in Puerto Rico.
Great news! The House dropped the GOP provision to delay financial protections for servicemembers: 
5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren‚Äôt bailed out. It‚Äôs a very big deal. It‚Äôs scary.
.@SenateDems won‚Äôt sit silently while the rich &amp; powerful rig our courts &amp; ram through even more radical right-wing pro-corporate judges.
Looking forward to joining you MT @GUPublicPolicy: Honored to welcome @SenWarren as our 2014 Whittington Lecturer 
After WWII a grateful nation helped soldiers get a college education. @realDonaldTrump should sign the #ForeverGIbill to help vets again.
.@SenateMajLdr still intends to vote on this shameful healthcare bill. CEOs have stayed quiet. They must speak up.

"""The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a GOP plan to defund women‚Äôs health care. I #standwithPP ‚Äì and I hope my colleagues will do the same."""
Great to see MA native Dr. Ernest Moniz unanimously confirmed as @ENERGY Secretary. I look forward to working with him.
Either @WellsFargo‚Äôs board failed to fully investigate the fraud for years or they knew about it and did nothing ‚Äì either is unacceptable.
All 11 MA congressmembers support universal background checks for gun sales. Thanks @mayortommenino for your leadership! #DemandAction
"Andrew Puzder plotted to replace his workers with machines because they are ""always polite"" &amp; ""never take a vacation."""
My thoughts are with @SteveScalise all those injured and the brave Capitol Police who protect us every day.
Today I spoke about @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to hand over the government to the worst special interests. Watch: 
And if @realDonaldTrump won‚Äôt follow the Constitution Congress must fight back every step of the way.  
Proud to introduce my first Senate amendment today to help support MA fishermen and their families 
Read my @TalkPoverty piece on why everyone who supports a strong @CFPB must continue fighting to protect it. 
A new analysis out today shows: Trumpcare will hit Massachusetts like a sledgehammer.

"People from MA &amp; across the country fought this cruel ""health care"" bill &amp; won. We proved: when we fight back we can win. THANK YOU."
More than half of @AnthemInc's revenue comes from programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But they're abandoning people in ACA exchanges.
The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals government workers employers &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.
In 2008 Wall Street got a bailout. What did those truck drivers dockworkers &amp; warehouse workers get? They got stuck with bill.
@VotingInMass: The voter registration deadline is 3 weeks away. Make sure your voter information is up to date:
Today the @SenateGOP is voting for a proposal to make it EASIER for Wall Street to cheat Americans out of the retirement savings.
The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.
Months ago I wrote to federal agencies explaining why this executive order violates the constitution. 
This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder‚Äôs @USDOL nomination. Some days the good guys win.

We'll keep fighting until the refugee &amp; #MuslimBan is permanently overturned. #NoBanNoWall
I'm still committed to reversing #CitizensUnited. We don't run this country for corporations we run it for people. 
I visited Jess &amp; Patrick at Walter Reed &amp; saw the state-of-the-art facilities &amp; world-class physicians who helped them recover more fully.

Rep @nikiinthehouse is more than my colleague - she's a mentor &amp; a friend. She has shown me how tough women fight for MA families.
Sen Kennedy showed me what it means to fight for working people. Watch my speech at the @emkinstitute this morning: 
When we fight we can win. I‚Äôm going to keep on fighting any attempts to weaken undermine or kill the @USDOL conflict of interest rule.
And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions‚Äôs radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us too.
We‚Äôve received heartbreaking stories of ppl hurt by OneWest Bank &amp; Steve Mnuchin. There‚Äôs still time to share yours:  
Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: 
SCOTUS affirmed what we‚Äôve known all along: the ACA was passed to provide all Americans access to more affordable comprehensive insurance.
One @HouseGOP bill being pushed this week HR 5424 would let private equity &amp; hedge funds disclose even LESS info to federal regulators.
I agree with @SenJackReed: The @HouseGOP needs to #ProtectOurTroops &amp; stop delaying Military Lending Act upgrades:

Annuity providers offer kickbacks ‚Äì cruises iPads Super Bowl-style rings ‚Äì so advisers will sell their products: 
Congress wasn‚Äôt elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules it‚Äôs time to fight back hard.
Health care pros want @SenateGOP to know: people without healthcare coverage are more likely to die than people with healthcare coverage. 
Every good proposal in the Cures Act will die unless Democrats help drug companies commit fraud give out kickbacks &amp; put patients at risk.
Passing this bipartisan bill is good for every American who can‚Äôt afford $5000 for hearing aids. We‚Äôre going to help a lot of people.
The real reason Wall St &amp; their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it‚Äôs working too darn well for consumers &amp; must be stopped.

The @OfficeGovEthics says he ‚Äú[doesn‚Äôt] think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be @POTUS.‚Äù I don‚Äôt either. 
Very glad to speak to @ShuttleCDRKelly today about ways we can keep fighting to #StopGunViolence in America. 
Today I visited @MassasoitTweets to talk w/ students about reducing the student loan burden  
Since the public got wind of the Big Pharma giveaways &amp; Congress started feeling the heat 21st Century Cures has changed a little.
I spent time in Estonia this week meeting with top officials &amp; visiting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence. 
It‚Äôs our duty to honor those who have served our nation with courage including those who have not made it home.
Glad to join @USAgainstAlz tonight to recognize @SenatorBarb's tireless work to end Alzheimer's. #WeWontWait 
It‚Äôs time for @usedgov's student loan bank to prove they care more about Corinthian‚Äôs victims than their own bottom line.
Great to talk about the importance of #immigrationreform w/ local business leaders at @iiicenter‚Äôs breakfast today
Millions of financial contracts have a clause limiting your right to go to court if you‚Äôre cheated so the @CFPB wrote a rule to stop that.
No one should have to pick between having a child &amp; paying her bills. I‚Äôm joining @BarackObama to #LeadOnLeave.  
The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They‚Äôre using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
Glad to intro @RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.  
Mnuchin's allies in Congress will do ANYTHING to protect @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs @USTreasury nominee &amp; please their Wall Street friends.
Proud to join Bostonians today at the Common to stand in solidarity with the people of Paris. #JeSuisParis

The Sen. passed a women's heart health resolution I introed w/ @lisamurkowski @SenatorBarb @SenatorCollins #screenus  
Let‚Äôs be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.
The GOP knows the way to undermine the @CFPB is to make it a commission. I‚Äôm not buying it. Dems shouldn't either. 
Today I wrote to @usedgov demanding their student loan bank halt collection of Corinthian students‚Äô debt: 
When Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes he took their homes.
The GOP can keep trying to deny millions access to health care but our experience in MA shows health reform works ‚Äì &amp; now it's here to stay
The GOP vote attacking family planning may deadlock. Will Trump really haul in @mike_pence to cast a historic vote against women‚Äôs health?
The only thing ‚Äì only thing ‚Äì that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
.@realDonaldTrump named Carl Icahn as his special adviser ‚Äì even though Icahn is still majority owner of a petroleum refining company.
.@usedgov Yet another gut punch to struggling student loan borrowers. And another reason we need the @CFPB to protect students when @usedgov fails.
Congrats to the @UMassAmherst Class of 2017! You did it! #umass2017 
Thoughts &amp; prayers are NOT enough. Not when more moms &amp; dads will bury kids this week &amp; more sons &amp; daughters will grow up without parents.
The FCC did the right thing by adopting strong rules for a free &amp; open Internet. This is a huge victory for the little guys. #NetNeutrality
.@usedgov DeVos rolled back protections that make it harder for student loan companies that cheat borrowers to keep raking in gov contracts.
Starting hour three of @SenateDems fighting to #holdthefloor to stop Trumpcare. Watch live:  #ShowUsTheBill
The President of the US should work for you ‚Äì &amp; not exploit the most powerful office in the world &amp; your tax dollars to make a quick buck.
The GOP budget doesn‚Äôt reflect MA‚Äôs values &amp; it doesn‚Äôt reflect America‚Äôs values. Read my new @masslivenews op-ed: 
The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this -- as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it.
Speaking on the Senate floor about how @realDonaldTrump still threatens to sabotage Americans‚Äô health care. Watch: 
Great to meet so many MA residents visiting the Capitol this morning! 
Big business lobbyists will spend millions attacking the @CFPB‚Äôs arbitration rule. We must be ready to fight back. 
Read our new report w/ workers in all 50 states saying what new overtime rules would mean to them:  #overdueOT
.@CFPB @WellsFargo The @SEC_News &amp; @TheJusticeDept should use all the tools they have to hold Stumpf &amp; @WellsFargo execs accountable under the law.
So will you keep your promise to protect Medicare &amp; Medicaid @realDonaldTrump? My colleagues &amp; I want to know: 
Today we remember Framingham‚Äôs Christa McAuliffe &amp; the astronauts we lost 30 yrs ago on #Challenger:

Report: Burger King will dodge up to $1.2 billion in taxes with its move to Canada  Antonio Weiss played a key role.
.@SenateGOP obstruct @POTUS's nominees just because they don‚Äôt like the guy doing the nominating. Read my report: 
Enjoyed meeting students at @UMassDMarSci1 yesterday in #NewBedford 
The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
Thank you @WhiteHouse for your commitment to protecting Wall Street reform. The big banks don‚Äôt need another giveaway. #SOTU
Today I joined @SenatorDurbin @SenJackReed &amp; @SenGillibrand to talk college &amp; my plan to reduce student debt #refi

I don‚Äôt love Wall St bankers who break our economy ‚Äì but I LOVED #TheBigShort. Great to meet @GhostPanther today! 
Big banks like @WellsFargo have no shame. No matter how much they hurt investors &amp; customers they're prowling to gut Dodd-Frank.
The game's over. If @Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate.
Proud to introduce @JohnKerry at his confirmation hearing for Secretary of State this morning at 10am. Hope you can tune in!
That means taxpayers have to spend billions ‚Äì and share personal info with 3rd-parties ‚Äì just to file taxes.

And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
America‚Äôs new chief banking regulator used to be the person defending big banks. @ChrisVanHollen and I blow the whistle on this scandal. 
Tell Congress: They work for the American people ‚Äî not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
When government agencies reach settlements with companies that break the law they should disclose the terms to the public.
Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.
For any and all these reasons today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov.

Just voted NO on the Paul amendment to repeal the ACA. This is the jump-off-a-cliff-and-figure-out-later-how-to-land plan.
What‚Äôs the end product? Families could pay even higher premiums to get care. More discrimination of those who need care most. More chaos.
Great meeting with #vabiz leaders of @VAChamber. Working across the aisle on federal priorities will help grow VA's economy 
We should allow students to use federal loans for short-term CTE programs #CTEMonth @actecareertech @CTEworks
