Another birthday in the books for the @USMC. You don‚Äôt look a day older than 240.To all the Marines out there active duty or vets thank you for your service. #SemperFi
Even GOP leaders are finally beginning to acknowledge that this plan could raise taxes on many middle class families. Too bad it took them getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar... 
Sexual assault and abuse is an epidemic. Grateful for your bravery in telling your story @diananyad. It's a shame that it's taken so many women sharing these private horrific stories in such public ways in order for us to begin to confront this. 
How about the middle class? How about small businesses? How about homeowners? CEOs are doing just fine. 
This is one of many important steps towards addressing and combating pervasive sexual harassment‚ÄîI'm glad to see it implemented across offices and hope other workplaces will follow suit. 
I am also grateful for Leigh Corfman's courage and voice ‚Äî all too often our systemic biases against women's stories and perspectives make it too difficult for women to come forward.
Today's revelations about Roy Moore are incredibly disturbing. We have to speak out against gross abuse like this. Moore should never be in the U.S. Senate. He should step aside‚Äîbut if he won‚Äôt the good people of Alabama must vote to defeat him.

All Americans should have access to affordable quality health insurance. I believe a public option helps us get there.
Medicare-X would first hit markets in rural counties or places w/o competition‚Äîwhere options are limited &amp; costs higher. Nationwide by 2023.
My Medicare-X bill with @SenBennetCO builds on Medicare's framework to give all Americans access to a public insurance plan on marketplaces.
We can't stand idly by as President Trump sabotages our healthcare system so I'm introducing a public option bill.
Praying for families of those killed &amp; for the injured. We must condemn terror wherever it occurs working together to combat it globally. 
Decertifying the #IranDeal guts US diplomacy and yes raises the serious risk of the Trump administration leading us into war.
What do Trump's actions say to North Korea? Any diplomatic solution‚Äîhowever small the chances‚Äîhinges on trusting our commitment.

Proud to see Virginia join the fight to prevent massive premium increases and coverage losses for countless families. 
The #IranDeal keeps us safer and more secure. And don't take my word for it. Ask President Trump's own Secretary of Defense. 
It's outrageous that POTUS is deliberately raising Americans' health care costs out of a blind opposition to the ACA. Read my statement: 
Many of my GOP colleagues have said POTUS should make these payments. It‚Äôs time we immediately pass bipartisan legislation to continue them.
President Trump appears willing to raise premiums for countless Americans just to try to blow up the ACA. This is cruel. 
@KamalaHarris: For those who want to help the victims of the #CaliforniaWildfires ‚Äî here are 8 things you can do right now: 
12 yrs ago @BarackObama visited VA to support my campaign for governor. Thrilled to welcome him back next wk to support @RalphNortham! #TBT 
@RobWittman: Virginia delegation unified in our letter to VA Sec. Shulkin on late payments in the Veterans Choice Program. 
What‚Äôs the end product? Families could pay even higher premiums to get care. More discrimination of those who need care most. More chaos.
It aims to push healthy people onto junk plans leaving only the sick or at-risk on ACA plans‚Äîessentially destroying the insurance market.
It would allow cheap low-quality plans onto the market that could discriminate against people with preexisting conditions seniors women...
President Trump‚Äôs health care executive order may seem a little complicated so let me break it down: It‚Äôs sabotage.
This would be a stunning abandonment of our fellow Americans in their time of greatest need. 
This should be unacceptable in America. 
Devastating to see this. Praying for all those affected and grateful for the first responders continuing to fight these fires &amp; save lives. 
Corker took an oath to defend the constitution‚Äînot a president or party. May not be how Breitbart sees it but take it up with the Founders. 
Going live on CNN @NewDay at 7:20 to talk about my bipartisan codel to #PuertoRico this weekend. We need to do more to help these Americans.

We need to be doing all we can to assist Puerto Rico in exceeding this projection so they can begin to recover and rebuild.
Was in #PuertoRico Saturday. Only 15% have power after 2wks. Hope to hit 25% by next month. 25%! Where else in USA would this be acceptable?
This would erode US leadership in tackling climate change &amp; set us back years in hastening clean energy &amp; job creation. Woefully misguided. 
Thanks to @chefjoseandres for heroic service providing meals and water to those in dire need in #PuertoRico. Citizen leadership at its best.

I‚Äôd support a #TaxReform plan that helps hardworking families &amp; businesses compete. I hope GOP will change course &amp; work with us on one.
6/ Lowers the tax rate for the top earners only to raise the tax rate for lowest earners.
5/ Blows up the debt. Allows these tax cuts to increase deficit $1.5 trillion.
4/ $1 trillion cut to Medicaid &amp; $470+ billion cut to Medicare ‚Äì programs that provide critical coverage to families kids &amp; seniors in VA.
3/ Gets rid of the state and local deductions that families across Virginia rely on. Average SALT deduction for a VA household is $11288.
2/ We were promised a ‚Äúmiddle class miracle.‚Äù But from limited details they‚Äôll share looks like many in middle class could see increases.
1/ Tax cuts are for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. 80% of the benefits could go to the top 1%.
Budget Cmte is diving into the Trump/GOP #TaxReform plan today &amp; what we‚Äôve seen is bad news for Virginia families‚Ä¶some of my big concerns:

#GrahamCassidy would've hurt countless Americans. I'll say it again: it's past time for us to work together to improve health care for all
Americans don't want #GrahamCassidy. We should return to the bipartisan process the HELP committee engaged in earlier this month
#GrahamCassidy cuts to Medicaid mean people w/ disabilities could have difficulty living independently. We shouldn't take away this freedom
"Kids seniors &amp; people w/ disabilities are at risk with #GrahamCassidy. ""New"" version still contains a massive cut to Medicaid"
Headed to the Senate floor to speak against the #GrahamCassidy proposal that threatens the health care of millions
@wamu885: Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine talked about the GOP attempts to change the health care landscape this morning 
if you want health care bills to improve care not take it away
Preliminary CBO score underscores the fact that millions of people stand to lose their health care under #GrahamCassidy 
Protections for pre-existing conditions. Medicaid. Essential health benefits. All would be threatend under #GrahamCassidy proposal 
"How can we even call #GrahamCassidy a ""health care"" proposal when it would take insurance away from an estimated 21 million people by 2026?"
"Hard to believe this was even possible but the ""new"" version of #GrahamCassidy is even worse for people with pre-existing conditions "
We can't rest easy until the GOP drops its effort to jam #Trumpcare through &amp; repeal the ACA. Make your voices heard this week.
Health care proposals should be a product of bipartisan collaboration. We serve America best when we work together #ProtectOurCare
The #GrahamCassidy proposal shatters President Trump's promises &amp; gets rid of ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions 
Experts agree: #GrahamCassidy will make coverage more expensive &amp; cause millions to lose care. Let's listen to them &amp; reject #Trumpcare 
Most Medicaid recipients are kids seniors &amp; people w/disabilities. They don't deserve to lose insurance under #Trumpcare
I'm proud of members of Virginia's Task Force 2 who are in Puerto Rico assisting the rescue efforts in the aftermath of #HurricaneMaria 
Just like 43/50 states did before the ACA was passed into law #SaveTheACA
Under #GrahamCassidy states could allow insurance companies to charge more to people with pre-existing conditions
A terrible choice that will make campuses less safe. We have to focus on protecting survivors &amp; this could discourage them from speaking out 
.@SenJohnMcCain is right: ‚ÄúI believe we could do better working together.‚Äù #GrahamCassidy is not how we improve health care for millions.
"if you agree ""health care"" bills should be about helping &amp; improving not repealing &amp; destroying"
Marea is a partnership between @Microsoft @Facebook &amp; @telxius that will benefit job growth in Hampton Roads region 
With @GovernorVA @MarkWarner &amp; @BradSmi in Williamsburg unveiling a new subsea cable b/t Hampton Roads &amp; Spain! 
@BradSmi: Excited to join @Facebook &amp; @timkainetoday to unveil Marea the highest capacity subsea cable to cross Atlantic. 
Ending #Medicaid as we know it hurts kids who depend on services to live their lives to the fullest. Tell your Senators NO to #Trumpcare
More than 301000 Virginians use the ACA's premium tax credits to afford health insurance. #GrahamCassidy ends this benefit for families
Introducing middle school students to #CareerTechEd  helps them succeed in jobs down the road. More in @BDTonline: 
"Relived HOME vs Nationwide while viewing ""Redlining Richmond"" exhibit at @bhm_va today. Proud we won this fight for civil rights &amp; equality "
Katherine Johnson helped @NASA reach new heights. This new @NASA_Langley research center will bear her name &amp; continue groundbreaking work 
I've always looked up to my father-in-law Linwood Holton. Thrilled to wish this great Virginian a happy 94th birthday today!
#GrahamCassidy bottom line: hurts millions of Americans - especially kids seniors those with pre-existing conditions - and raises costs
Not true but don't take it from me. Listen to patients medical groups &amp; doctors who oppose #GrahamCassidy for this reason too 
if you want Republicans to stop their latest effort to repeal the ACA and take coverage from millions
Wishing a very happy new year to all those celebrating #RoshHashanah in Virginia and across the world today
Joined a discussion at @CBCFInc forum to hear how #CareerTechEd can support formerly incarcerated people by better preparing them for jobs 
Questioned Navy leadership yesterday if investigation would look at whether changes in training could have impacted deadly incidents at sea 
No one ever spends a dollar on anything more important than their health and #GrahamCassidy will force families to pay more for less care
Nearly every major health care organization is opposed to the #GrahamCassidy bill. Why? It hurts patients kids &amp; seniors
.@CAPAction study shows 839000 in Virginia would lose coverage. #GrahamCassidy is a disaster. Make your voices heard say no to #Trumpcare 
Praying for our friends in Puerto Rico as they face another dangerous hurricane. Please heed all warnings.
My heart goes out to the people of Mexico. We always stand with our neighbors to the South especially during this difficult time
Agree. The Senate can do this but GOP members want to end good faith talks to try and pass #Trumpcare again. Millions will lose health care 
Bipartisan governors know #GrahamCassidy would be a disaster just like previous #Trumpcare ACA repeal efforts were 
...treatment for mental health &amp; substance abuse disorders Rx drugs pediatric care helping people w/disabilities &amp; chronic diseases 2/2
#GrahamCassidy includes an age tax on seniors &amp; lets states waive protections for maternity newborn &amp; preventive care hospitalization 1/2
Americans are loud &amp; clear: they want Congress working together to improve the health care system not #GrahamCassidy #TrumpCare repeal bill
Make no mistake #GrahamCassidy bill is a repeal of the ACA that guts Medicaid &amp; would hurt seniors kids people with disabilities
We‚Äôre going to fight this tooth and nail. It‚Äôs bad for Virginia &amp; bad for the country. 
We need your voices now more than ever. Let your Senators know you want bipartisan health care fixes not a #GrahamCassidy repeal of the ACA 
Great to see Richmond recognized by @RWJF with a #CultureOfHealthPrize. #RVA has made great strides in improving community health
Dr. Carrier helped make @JMU a world-class institution. My condolences to his family &amp; the entire JMU community as they remember Uncle Ron
#GrahamCassidy bill would be a disaster for Virginia 
Many wins in #NDAA for the troops but we owe them an important debate on #AUMF. They sacrifice so much &amp; deserve to know we have their backs
I'm proud Senate stood with me in support of $10 billion in additional funding for the Navy critical to Hampton Roads &amp; our shipbuilders
The #NDAA will make a difference in the lives of Virginians. It supports our servicemembers &amp; the work of our defense community
We have to know the effects on millions of families' care &amp; how much this will cost them before voting on #GrahamCassidy bill 
Senate HELP Committee is working on fixes to stabilize market &amp; lower premiums. #GrahamCassidy bill would undercut this bipartisan effort
#GrahamCassidy bill would change Medicaid hurting VA's children seniors people with disabilities and people with substance use disorders
#GrahamCassidy bill threatens protections for those with pre-existing conditions
#GrahamCassidy #TrumpCare bill would hurt millions of Americans. Virginia would face a $3.8 billion health care cut in 2027 alone
Coastal communities need resilient infrastructure investments to withstand stronger storms caused by #climatechange 
So let's vigorously &amp; respectfully play the roles we have the fortune to inhabit. So many around the world don't have the freedoms we do
We must always balance that popular activism with a requirement to be peaceful--violence has no place in civic discussion
From nationwide Women's Marches to spontaneous demonstrations against the Muslim ban &amp; stopping repeal of the ACA people power works
Let's celebrate the role of the individual to vote speak peacefully protest &amp; shape through civic activism the direction of the country
Today is the 230th anniversary of the Constitution &amp; as we celebrate #ConstitutionDay we need to fully grasp the heritage we have inherited
VA has come a long way toward equality. We have more work to do but we‚Äôve made progress and we won‚Äôt let ourselves be dragged backwards.
As demonstrations are expected in Richmond today it‚Äôs critically important that everyone stays peaceful. Violence is never acceptable.
Excited to take the stage on the VA/TN state line with TN @senalexander at #BristolRhythm. 
@UTMCorporate My bill w/ @SenCapito focuses on this strategy to intro students to #CareerTechEd early to solve workforce shortages 
Met w/ @UTMCorporate workers &amp; community leaders in Washington County to learn abt their ideas to educate students on career opportunities 
@GovernorVA @MarkWarner Especially welcome news for VA‚Äôs rural counties that have been hurt by Pres Trump‚Äôs efforts to sabotage health care ‚Äì this needs to stop.
Anthem staying in VA is great news. Proud of our joint efforts on this w/ @GovernorVA @MarkWarner &amp; others. More work ahead for Congress.
What my faith has taught me: If we unite in mind and purpose we can develop simple solutions to improve health care. 
Hispanic Americans have made immeasurable contributions to our nation &amp; Virginia #HispanicHeritageMonth
My heart goes out to those injured in the terror attack in #London &amp; our friends in the UK. Praying for their swift recovery.
My kind of humor. Love being back in SWVA 
Stopped by one of my favorite spots @Heartwood_SWVA this am. Huge asset to the community w/ artists from 19 SWVA counties displaying art 
My bill w/@SenCapito will expose middle school students to skills needed for good jobs in their towns #CareerTechEd 
CBO confirms Pres Trump‚Äôs approach means higher premiums and fewer insured. Congress has to lead in improving health care for all Americans 
Congress owes it to our troops to debate &amp; vote on an #AUMF. @WashingtonPost Ed Board agrees it's time to step up 
Today I warned insurers against leaving rural communities in Virginia behind: 
"A sneak peak into the set list for ""The Amateurs"" tomorrow at @BristolRhythm "
Voted to support the Paul amdt to #NDAA. We owe it to our troops risking their lives to vote on an AUMF &amp; I hope this accelerates the debate
Glad Congress unanimously condemns white supremacist violence in Charlottesville &amp; urges the President to do the same. No hate in my state! 
"@LoopEmma: @RandPaul New: In a few mins @timkaine ""will speak in support of Paul‚Äôs amendment as a way to accelerate a debate and mark u‚Ä¶"
Great to meet with the new President of Newport News Shipbuilding Jennifer Boykin today. Always impressed by @HIIndustries shipbuilders
DREAMers like Nelly in Richmond help make America great #ProtectDREAMers #HereToStay 
Proud our #Charlottesville res unanimously passed Senate tonight. One step closer to formally recognizing the lives lost &amp; condemning hate
Excited to break out the harmonica again later this week &amp; jam with @SenAlexander in Bristol!   
Joined Arlington first responders &amp; county officials at a wreath laying ceremony to honor those we lost on #September11th this morning 
Headed to a ceremony in Arlington to honor the lives we lost 16 years ago on #September11
Praying for all of Florida this morning. Virginia is with you.
Applaud the 9th circuit. America should be for keeping families together. The travel ban is discriminatory &amp; wrong 
Ending DACA is heartless and I agree with the @roanoketimes ed board it's also bad for the economy in rural VA  
Virginia stands ready to help Florida and all states that will be affected by Hurricane Irma: 
Glad Congress avoided a shutdown &amp; passed emergency relief funds. This is just a start - we must continue to fund Harvey &amp; Irma recovery
Alex Smith is terrific a real commander-in-Chief! 
Glad you and your parents are safe and out of harm's way 
These governors are exactly right. It's time to act and put the bipartisan DREAM Act on the floor for a vote. #ProtectDREAMers 
Any #TitleIX policy that deters or discourages a survivor of sexual assault from speaking out &amp; seeking justice is not progress 
Following Pres Trump's broken promise on DACA Congress should act now to pass the DREAM Act &amp; give #DREAMers the protection they deserve
Pres Trump turned his back on 12000 VA #DREAMers. I'm about to share some of their amazing stories on the Senate floor #ProtectDREAMers
DACA has allowed more than 7000 DREAMers to work in and contribute to Virginia. Ending DACA would hurt our economy #ProtectDREAMers
Thx to President Sullivan for standing with @UVA #DREAMers #HereToStay 
There are 1200+ #DREAMers enrolled at public universities &amp; colleges in Virginia. They're talented &amp; driven students who are #HereToStay
@SenatorCarper: What does my bill with @timkaine the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act include? Reinsurance. htt‚Ä¶
Our resolution honors the three brave Virginians who died &amp; commits us all including President Trump to do better as we combat hate 
Praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Irma. Please heed the warnings from emergency officials. Don't wait to get yourself to safety
Thank you @AGMarkHerring for fighting for Virginia #DREAMers in the courts. First &amp; foremost Congress must quickly pass the DREAM Act 
Bipartisan hearings can help us find health care fixes for Virginia's patients &amp; families. Tune in at 10am: 
Presented our resolution to @AlexandriaVAPD w/@MarkWarner today for their heroism during the attack on Members of Congress &amp; staff in June 
Look forward to working w/@PattyMurray &amp; @SenAlexander on ways to stabilize the insurance market &amp; lower premiums. Hearings start tomorrow 
These are a few of the 12000 Virginia DREAMers who President Trump betrayed today. Congress must pass the DREAM Act to protect them. 
@BarackObama: To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong because they‚Äôve done nothing wrong. My statement: 
In the wake of the President‚Äôs heartless decision to end DACA Congress must immediately pass the bipartisan DREAM Act to protect #DREAMers
Rescinding DACA forces #DREAMers back into the shadows &amp; puts them in danger of being deported from the country they love &amp; know as home
Ending DACA is a heartless decision that breaks the President's promise to kids who were brought here through no fault of their own
if you support #DACA and #DREAMers who make our nation stronger #DefendDACA
On this Labor Day a reminder we must continue to do better to support workers' rights and fair pay: 
Happy #LaborDay to all of Virginia's workers. You are the foundation of our economy &amp; help keep our Commonwealth moving forward
"RIP Walter Becker ""Stone piano playing for me/a song without words or harmony/ Stone piano Calvary bound/rolling along with the top down."" "
Tangier is a hardworking community and I loved spending time with the locals to hear about what they need to confront this challenge 
North Korean nuke test requires a serious strategy from the President. He shouldn't belittle the ally most threatened by NK aggression 
This decision would be a retreat from US leadership especially as South Korea - home to 135000+ American citizens - deals w/North Korea 
#DREAMers came out of the shadows trusting in the American promise. President Trump would betray them if he ends #DACA. #DefendDACA
Keep making your voices heard to #DefendDACA. Tell Pres Trump why America is a place where kids should get the chance to pursue their dreams
"To me they're just called ""jokes."" "
The President continues to sabotage our health care system instead of focusing on real improvements to help American families 
The Amateurs at Bristol Rhythm and Roots. Be there or be square! @BristolRhythm @SenAlexander 
Some want to drag Virginia back to the days of hatred ‚Äì today I‚Äôm with this strong community in Dumfries to say we won‚Äôt go back 
@ACLUVA: In Va 12k of our neighbors family &amp; friends used their #DACA status to give back to our country in innumerable ways. Ending D‚Ä¶
"Si elimina DACA Trump traicionar√≠a a los Dreamers despu√©s que dijo que los tratar√≠a con ""coraz√≥n."" Estos j√≥venes fortalecen nuestro pa√≠s."
"If he ends DACA Trump would betray #DREAMers he said he'd treat w/ ""great heart."" These incredible young people make our country stronger."
Make no mistake: this would be a heartless decision that goes back on his word and puts thousands at risk of separation from their families 
Walked through historic Leesburg w/ Mayor Burk to chat w/ community members abt investment in local infrastructure &amp; econ dev to create jobs 
Spent my morning w/ Loudoun County biz owners discussing how I'm going to stand up for VA small businesses as we take on big debates in Sept 
It's true. I am getting older.
Great to be in studio at @ABC7News this morning and catch up with @ABC7Autria &amp; the @ABC7GMW team! 
These kids came out of the shadows believing in the promise of America. Tell President Trump not to send them back. #DefendDACA
Gloria a #Dreamer from VA will be one of four DACA recipients to graduate from law school in December - the first in VA #DefendDACA

Dreamers have made Virginia stronger &amp; our economy more successful. America will always be a nation of immigrants #DefendDACA
Met w/ these incredible Virginia Dreamers this afternoon. Join me in telling Pres Trump that ending DACA would be a big mistake #DefendDACA 
Meeting with a group of #Dreamers today in Alexandria to hear how DACA has helped them pursue their dreams &amp; strengthen Virginia #DefendDACA 
Thank you @ForestryVA. 
For 5 years DACA has helped nearly 800000 young people - including 12000+ in VA - pursue their dreams &amp; contribute to America #DefendDACA

Pres Trump's transgender military ban &amp; Arpaio pardon are more proof of his opposition to our country's North Star: all are created equal
Hoping KC can make up ground tonight. AL Central rocks. Go @Royals! #RaisedRoyal 
Sending my prayers to those in the path of #HurricaneHarvey. Stay safe.
.@virginianpilot ed board gets it right. We should not ask our troops to continue to risk their lives without clearly defining their mission 
This is reckless. POTUS threatening to shut down our government over an ineffective wall would hurt Virginia &amp; cost taxpayers billions 
The American public deserves more details from POTUS on Afghanistan. Congress should ask for the specifics and then debate &amp; vote on an AUMF
Can't wait to see the total solar eclipse. I watched the last one on my 21st birthday--February 26 1979. Time flies! #SolarEclipse2017
Praying for the @USNavy missing sailors. Armed Services Committee must hold a hearing to get answers on why these collisions are happening
In studio with the @Morning_Joe crew to talk Charlottesville &amp; Afghanistan. Tune in soon.
Joining @FaceTheNation this morning to discuss how Virginia &amp; our country can respond to the hatred we saw in Charlottesville with progress
Our response to the hate &amp; bigotry that came to Charlottesville should be to accelerate progress toward equality 
When I was Governor we saw the need for better health care on Tangier &amp; took action. The Nichols Health Center has made a real difference. 
Mayor Ooker was generous enough to show us around the island on his crab boat and point out damage from recent storms. 
Thankful to local Tangier leaders for taking time to discuss the island‚Äôs challenges and ways to address them with me. 
Saddened by the terror attack in #Barcelona. My heart goes out to the victims their families and our friends in Spain. Estamos contigo.
Live look from the ferry to Tangier. Watching UFCW Local 400 fisherman out of Reedville working on the Chesapeake Bay harvesting menhaden! 
Taking the ferry from Reedville to Tangier for a day on the island 
White supremacists &amp; those who embolden them want to drag Virginia back to the days of hatred &amp; bigotry. We will not go back.
Met with President Sullivan &amp; @MikeSigner in Charlottesville this morning to thank them for their moral leadership during this painful time 
Joined many with heavy hearts at the memorial service honoring Heather Heyer‚Äôs life today. We should all aspire to love people as she did 
Virginia won't let anyone take us backwards - whether it's white supremacists or a President who emboldens them
Charlottesville violence was fueled by one side: white supremacists spreading racism intolerance &amp; intimidation. Those are the facts.
Two of Virginia's finest lost their lives today protecting the Commonwealth from violence. My thoughts and prayers are with their families.
My full statement on the horrifying white supremacist demonstrations and violence in Charlottesville: 
People who came to VA to spew hate &amp; incite violence have no place here. We stand for inclusion and will not go backwards. Praying for peace
Proud the bipartisan Metro Safety Commission passed &amp; is headed to the President. It will ensure WMATA follows the toughest standards. 
There are 200000 vacant cybersecurity jobs in the U.S. &amp; it will grow to 1.5 million by 2019. We need to meet this demand now.
Expanding telehealth is the right thing to do especially for rural Virginia veterans. Our veterans deserve quality fast care. 
About to join @NewDay to talk about passing a new AUMF &amp; why bipartisan hearings on health care in Senate HELP Cmte are a major step forward
Great step forward for my bill w/@SenatorWicker to increase the number of #cybersecurity scholarships! 
Proud of the bipartisan work that went into this bill to help improve veterans‚Äô civilian experience &amp; access to GI Bill education benefits 
Productive briefing w/Secs Mattis &amp; Tillerson. It's in the country's best interest to show American resolve in war on terror with a new AUMF
The @urbaninstitute cites reinsurance and outreach and enrollment as steps we should take to stabilize the markets: 
How we can help stabilize health care markets now: reinsurance and guarantee CSR payments 
Here's a recap of the Flake/Kaine AUMF. Congress owes it to our troops &amp; the public to debate an AUMF 
Headed to AUMF briefing w/ Mattis &amp; Tillerson. We need to hear about the Administration's perspective on a new authorization
Glad HELP will take up health care fixes. I've been asking for this since January &amp; have a bill that will reduce premiums. We can do this! 
@SenJohnMcCain: Good news @SenAlexander &amp; @PattyMurray to hold hearings on #Obamacare - may be a step in the right direction 
Glad to work w/@GovernorVA to send retiring troops a letter listing state services for veterans. Virginia ‚ù§Ô∏è Vets! 
Important step tonight to fund new VA medical facilities. Fought with @MarkWarner for two new ones in Virginia approved in this bill
Great to see VA Choice funding pass but still need permanent improvements to Choice and increase in the VA's capacity to provide care
Seniors should not have to choose b/w groceries &amp; lifesaving medication. This bill gives Medicare stronger footing to negotiate lower prices
Joining @amyklobuchar on a bill to lower prescription drug costs. This is another example of health care fix both parties should agree on
In Virginia we know firsthand the severity of the opioid epidemic &amp; people need our help now. POTUS should work on strategies to save lives 
Proud to work w/@VaVeteransSvcs to welcome home veterans &amp; make sure they know more about services in VA as they transition to civilian life 
GM Wiedefeld is starting to steer WMATA ship in the right direction. Fed state locals all need to do their part to maintain progress 
Joined @MarkWarner @SenatorCardin &amp; @ChrisVanHollen today to hear directly from @wmata GM Wiedefeld on Metro progress
Major step in the right direction. HELP members can work together hear from patients providers &amp; experts on how we improve health care 
Outdoor recreation economy is important to VA. We love it so much nearly 200000 Virginians have their jobs because of it! More from @OIA 
One of the first steps to help strengthen the ACA is to stabilize the individual marketplace &amp; lower premiums. Our reinsurance bill can help
We avoided a health care catastrophe but the Senate needs to work on improvements. Look forward to HELP Committee debate
If President Trump did this he would be purposefully sabotaging the health care system &amp; hurting American families

The next step is not more partisan #TrumpCare bills! We must work together to find bipartisan solutions to lower costs &amp; improve care
Senate Democrats and Republicans have already rejected three versions of ACA repeal because it would harm millions of people

After last night's health care debate in the Senate I continued the conversation in Manassas today with disability rights advocates 
Ate lunch at Yorkshire Diner the oldest restaurant in Prince William County with community leaders to talk about local priorities 
Thanks @SenAngusKing for the assist on the floor chart last night - an all hands on deck effort to #SaveOurCare 
Thank you to the countless Americans who made their voices heard. You helped defeat a bill tonight that would hurt millions.
Tonight we put people over politics. Let's work together going forward to improve health care.
GOP Senators have one last chance to get this right: vote now to send it to Committee &amp; give the public a bipartisan debate on health care
A vote for #SkinnyRepeal is salt in the wound for millions of American families who are worried about their health care.
This is not a 'skinny' plan - it's a plan with terrible consequences resulting in millions of Americans losing health care
How can GOP Senators vote yes on this 'disaster' of a bill? 
Virginia families could feel the impact of a skinny repeal bill right away. It would increase premiums 20% next year alone
What happens with a skinny repeal? 16 million uninsured. Collapse of health care markets. 20% premium increase. Defunds Planned Parenthood
Message to my GOP colleagues thinking of voting yes on a bill they hope won't become law: If üëèyouüëèpassüëèthisüëèitüëèwillüëèbecomeüëèlaw. 
"Make no mistake once the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" the House will send it to Trump to sign into law. Kicks millions off insurance."
GOP has dropped plan to use ‚Äúskinny repeal‚Äù as a vehicle to get to a conference. Now House will pass it as is &amp; send to WH hurting millions 
We need everyone to make their voices heard today so we can stop this #TrumpCare bill in the Senate
Still haven't seen the GOP health care bill we are voting on. Is this really how the GOP wants to conduct business on people's health care?
Health care isn't a game but Republicans are choosing to treat it like one. The Senate is better than this #SaveACA #ProtectOurCare
Thank you @GovernorVA. 'Skinny repeal' is just another way to say millions will lose their health care. 
Another Senate GOP health care bill that causes millions to lose insurance raises premiums on VA families - breaking Pres Trump's promises 
Americans - healthy and sick - need us to get this right. The Senate needs to #SaveACA &amp; vote no on GOP repeal
We're fighting to make sure people with disabilities get the care they need #ADA27 #SaveACA
Met w/Virginia kids from @JDRF today. I'll fight cuts to federal dollars that support medical research for #T1D cures &amp; treatments #JDRFCC17 
Republican Rx for health care? Taking insurance away from millions &amp; raising premiums. American families deserve better than this
.@SenateDems are holding strong against hurting folks. Let's keep the pressure on #SaveOurCare
Senate Republican repeal only bill-- kicking 30+ million off health insurance--got 45 votes just now
Senate Republican repeal and replace bill--kicking millions off health insurance--got 43 votes last night
Reminder: ACA repeal would cause 32 MILLION people to lose insurance &amp; premiums to double. This would be devastating for American families.
Just voted NO on the Paul amendment to repeal the ACA. This is the jump-off-a-cliff-and-figure-out-later-how-to-land plan.
I'm using this test for votes on GOP health care bills: will it raise costs for Virginians and/or take their care away? If so I'll vote no
GOP health care bill will cause Virginians to lose insurance &amp; pay much more for health care. Why aren't we helping people get better care?
The stakes could not be higher when it comes to people's health care. Call your Senators to share your stories &amp; ask them to #SaveACA
The message I'm hearing from families in every corner of VA: #SaveACA &amp; #ProtectOurCare. We were elected to help people not hurt them
Also ‚Äì did the President really consult military leaders on this? Four Star General told SASC a week ago they wanted time to review this
I disagree with this decision. If you are qualified to serve you shouldn't be banned from the military 
This week I'm fighting to #SaveACA for every kid parent senior &amp; person with a disability who is feeling fear over GOP plans to repeal
Joined friends @MoveOn &amp; @LittleLobbyists after the Senate vote today. The fight isn't over on health care. 
Now more than ever make your voices heard. Tell Republicans to reverse course #SaveACA &amp; stop playing games with your health care!
The GOP has set in motion a bill to take health care from millions. It's not too late to stop this.
Headed to the floor for what might be my most monumental Senate vote yet. I'm voting NO on first step to take health care away from millions
if you want the Senate to #SaveACA &amp; vote no on any bill that would take health care away from millions
@AARP: Call 1-844-222-0110 right now and tell your Senators to stand up for you and kill this higher-cost less-coverage bill once and‚Ä¶
If we just take the time health care deserves we can get this right
Republicans haven't just shut Democrats out on the health care bill they‚Äôve shut out the American people. It's plain wrong.
Why is GOP leadership forcing a vote on a secret bill without listening to patients doctors &amp; American families about the consequences?
This is such an important week in the United States Senate. Call a Republican Senator. Explain to him or her what‚Äôs at stake for your family
Humbled to receive a @FaithNPolitics award named for @repjohnlewis. He‚Äôs a model of faith and service to others 
Tonight I'll take to the Senate floor to share health care stories from across the Commonwealth. Virginians want us to protect their care!
Repealing the ACA would kick 32 million off of health insurance. Keep making your voices heard this week. Tell the GOP not to repeal!
Gabriella Miller inspired me &amp; countless others. Talked w/ her mom today about funding pediatric research @smashingwalnuts @thetruth365film 
GOP is still saying we‚Äôll vote on a repeal bill tomorrow but won‚Äôt say which one. What we do know: tens of millions would lose insurance
Dems unite around an economic vision to boost pay &amp; create jobs. It‚Äôs worked for VA &amp; will lead to a better future for American families 
‚Äú¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚Äù is not a viable plan for a bill that could potentially deprive 30+ million people of health insurance

@LittleLobbyists: 13/13 Anna‚Äôs senator @TimKaine is fighting for Anna. We can too. 
We need you to make your voices heard this week! Ask Republicans to protect health care &amp; drop their repeal of the ACA
Awesome rally to protect health care today at @RoanokeCollege. Thanks to all who came out. I'm going to do everything I can to stop repeal. 
"Perfect coffee stop at Zorba's on the way to a rally to protect health care. Owner Adel aka ""Zorba"" asked me to stop repeal. "
Grabbed breakfast this am at one of my favorite Roanoke area stops Local Anthony's with some community leaders. Was great to catch up! 
#USSGeraldRFord is an important milestone in the transformation of our @USNavy. Congrats to Hampton Roads shipbuilders on a job well done! 
Great catching up with old friends in Salem at @ParkwayBrewing tonight 
The moment when @GovernorVA realized the @ramusaorg volunteer he was thanking was me 
I'm always moved by the spirit of service in Wise at the @ramusaorg clinic. Glad I could come volunteer again this year! 
Rural hospitals would be hit hard by Trump/Republican health care proposals. Will be in SWVA tomorrow to listen to concerns &amp; get input.
Excited to spend time in Wise County tomorrow with @ramusaorg! Such an important org that delivers care to thousands in need 
Should make for an interesting next Cabinet meeting... 
@SenJohnMcCain: I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress I'll be back soon‚Ä¶
Thinking about a hero my Chairman my friend John McCain. Stay strong!
Supporting @PPFA patients &amp; advocates in DC today who are demanding the GOP stop attacking access to care #IStandWithPP
I'm hearing from Virginians what I know my colleagues are hearing too: improve the ACA don't repeal it. It's time to work on fixes together
Latest CBO score confirms what we already knew about ACA repeal. 32 million people would lose health insurance. Premiums would double
It's always great to hear from my office's interns answer their questions and learn more about their future plans! 
President Trump is learning that the #FactsStrikeBack. When you break promises to people about their health care they will remember 
The reason #TrumpCare failed in Senate: the American people. Families spoke out about how ACA &amp; Medicaid have been a lifeline for their kids

I'll share why I think there needs to be a 21st century Truman Doctrine shortly #NatSec 
About to join @Morning_Joe to discuss why it's time for the Senate to listen to the public &amp; work together on health care
@hereandnow: What comes next for the Affordable Care Act? Sen. Tim Kaine (@timkaine) joins @hereandnowrobin to weigh in: 
Today's recap: we saw a bipartisan group of Governors GOP Senators &amp; countless Americans reject an ACA repeal. The message is clear. 
Pres Trump would rather hurt Americans by sabotaging the ACA than back a bipartisan solution that actually keeps his promises to the public
if you want the Senate GOP to drop their effort to repeal Obamacare &amp; focus on bipartisan health care fixes
To GOP: drop ACA repeal. Let's start enacting bipartisan reforms like reinsurance that will stabilize insurance market &amp; lower premiums
The Senate has to move forward to make health care stronger not destroy it. Repeal would double premiums &amp; 32 million would lose coverage
Many of us have been pushing bipartisan approach for months. We're ready to work together to fix health care @SenateMajLdr 
Headed to Senate floor. Virginians want us working on bipartisan health care fixes not an ACA repeal bill that kicks millions off insurance
.@SenJohnMcCain calls it right: Time for the committees to hold hearings and work in a bipartisan way to find solutions
McConnell's new plan--repeal only--hurts millions of people and destabilizes the largest sector of our economy
The collapse of #TrumpCare is good news for America. Now let's work together to improve health care
Keep making your voice heard until Republicans agree to drop #TrumpCare once and for all!
Breaking: #TrumpCare lacks GOP support to pass Senate. Time for bipartisan public debate on bills to fix health care not break it
.@GeorgeWill highlights why Congress should stop ducking its constitutional duty &amp; debate and vote on a new AUMF 
HELP Cmte members are eager to work with GOP on health care fixes. There are good bills out there that would reduce costs improve care
What could be so bad about having the health care committees (HELP &amp; Finance) take a look and discuss health care?
With #TrumpCare vote delayed Senate should be using this week to hold public hearings &amp; listen to patients families doctors &amp; nurses
GOP leaders should listen to the American people drop the repeal effort &amp; start working with Democrats on health care fixes 
The end result for Americans under #TrumpCare: higher costs less care. We should be working on bipartisan fixes to bring down costs
#TrumpCare would allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions - that's just plain wrong
By weakening essential health benefits under #TrumpCare the GOP would expose older Americans to higher out-of-pocket costs
Another broken promise. Pres Trump needs to ditch #TrumpCare. Cutting #Medicaid undermines states efforts to fight addiction &amp; save lives 
Best wishes for a speedy recovery to my friend @SenJohnMcCain
Proud to support @womensmarch and partners as they marched 18 miles from #NRA2DOJ this weekend!
Republican &amp; Democratic governors agree: #TrumpCare would hurt their states 
Got the chance to share why I love the Appalachian Trail w/ @AT_Conservancy this week &amp; thank the volunteers who keep the Trail pristine! 
The GOP health care bill guts protections for people with pre-existing conditions by pricing them out of care #TrumpCare
Over 600000 of #Medicaid recipients in Virginia are children. #TrumpCare would jeopardize their care #KeepKidsCovered
"The ""new"" version of #TrumpCare still hurts states‚Äô ability to combat opioid and drug addiction - an epidemic in VA"
#TrumpCare would kick millions of Americans off of Medicaid including working families elderly Americans in nursing homes &amp; children
It's time for President Trump to stop dragging his feet on a strategy to combat the opioid epidemic 
Proud to introduce a bill w/@SenThomTillis to help veterans make the transition into civilian life by improving GI Bill education experience 
Despite millions making their voices heard on the need to protect people with pre-existing conditions #TrumpCare now targets them 
"@cheddar: Senator @timkaine on the GOP's healthcare bill: ""It's a tax cut bill financed by slashing Medicaid to the vulnerable."" #Chedda‚Ä¶"
I'll be live on @cheddar at 9am to talk #TrumpCare &amp; why I'm fighting in the Senate to #SaveMedicaid #CheddarLIVE 
I‚Äôm eager to work across the aisle on health care fixes - like my bill to stabilize the marketplace and lower premiums
I heard about some of the exciting work these @OrbitalATK interns have been up to in Dulles VA this summer! Great job training opportunity 
Americans overwhelmingly want bipartisan health care fixes not a repeal of the ACA. GOP lawmakers need to listen üëá 
.@AARP reports close to 500000 Virginians will lose coverage by 2022 with #TrumpCare
Under #TrumpCare in 2020 60-year-olds in Virginia earning $45000 could pay as much as $10610 more a year in premiums
#TrumpCare unfairly penalizes older Virginians who buy coverage on their own and forces them to pay more
Over 600000 kids in Virginia rely on Medicaid services. I'm standing up against #TrumpCare for them &amp; their families
It's time for Republicans to work with us in a bipartisan way on health care #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid
@vablood: Every two seconds someone needs blood. Current blood supplies are dangerously low. We need you! Make an appt now 
Today is the internet day of action to protect #NetNeutrality. Stand with me to ensure a free and open internet for Virginians!
Joining my friend @JeffFlake at @TheWilsonCenter this morning to discuss our bipartisan AUMF. Watch live: 
Headed to the Senate floor to share what Virginia moms told me about #TrumpCare: #Medicaid is a lifeline for their families
@AmerAcadPeds: Thank you @timkaine for taking time yesterday to hear why Medicaid matters to pediatricians &amp; children with complex needs‚Ä¶
My office has received more than 11000 calls letters and emails and 98 percent of them are saying not to pass #TrumpCare
We need everyone who is opposed to the #TrumpCare bill to continue to make your voices heard loud and clear!
if you want Senate Republicans to start over and work with Democrats on a bipartisan plan to improve the health care system
Republicans need to get serious about improving the American health care system. #TrumpCare sabotages the progress made under ACA
By slashing #Medicaid #TrumpCare would deal a huge blow to state budgets including $1.4 billion Virginia receives from the program
#TrumpCare would result in millions of Americans losing coverage &amp; people paying thousands more $$ in premiums. Time for a better proposal
Joining @mitchellreports soon to discuss #TrumpCare &amp; latest in Russia news
Mothers of kids w/complex medical conditions told me this in Northern VA today on #TrumpCare: Medicaid is a lifeline &amp; it can't be cut 
Headed to Springfield for a health care roundtable. I want to make sure that parents &amp; doctors concerned about #TrumpCare are heard
America shouldn't be in the business of appeasing Russia. They attacked our democracy. POTUS should show backbone &amp; hold them accountable. 
Thank you for sharing your story @DonnaFEdwards. She's right. #TrumpCare would target people w/pre-existing conditions. It's plain wrong. 
Reminder heading into next week: I have a bill to improve the marketplace that Ds &amp; Rs can agree on. Americans don't want #TrumpCare. 
Sent a letter w/@amyklobuchar to Trump's voter commission demanding answers. How will they use state data &amp; guarantee no voter suppression? 
HUD needs to reinstate resources that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. Removing these from the website was wrong 
#Trumpcare #Medicaid cuts could threaten reimbursements Virginia public schools receive to help care for students 
Applaud @GovernorVA for leading the way in Virginia. This overreach violates privacy &amp; raises fears of voter suppression 
@DrueKataoka: Just out: @TIME article @TimKaine &amp; I wrote on the critical importance of the #arts to stimulate #innovationPls RT
Shared my thoughts with @Refinery29 on what really makes America great 
Wednesday afternoon read: @ACFDPIO leading the way w/ cool program training young girls for careers in firefighting: 
On average #Trumpcare would make young adults pay 144% more for their plan: 
Hope everyone in Virginia and across the country has a happy 4th of July with family and friends!#IndependenceDay
In VA the avg monthly premium would increase from $182 to $302 for some plans under #Trumpcare - a 66% increase 
And that's the power of the press! A check against tyranny. But in 2017 some still don't appreciate it 
July 4 was the day the Declaration text was finalized &amp; went to the printer to be published &amp; distributed to the world
So why do we celebrate Independence Day on July 4?
The Declaration of Independence was approved on July 2 1776 and John Adams predicted the day would live on forever
After the wedding--welcoming Karly to the family! 
Groom and best man--2 hours to the wedding! 
Later today my oldest son Nat gets married. Reminds me of a day almost 33 years ago! Stay tuned for pics! 
I share @DAVHQ's concern over how #Trumpcare could hurt care for 8000 of Virginia's veterans 
President Trump prefers to play politics with the health care of millions instead of working with Democrats to make things better 
#Trumpcare devastates Medicaid in the future. Tax cuts paid for by slashing health care for kids seniors &amp; disabled 
"Press criticism is part of being POTUS but President Trump can't handle it. From Truman: ""If you can't stand the heat..."""
Glad to see more support in Congress for a new AUMF. Flake/Kaine AUMF offers a bipartisan framework
Kim from Ashburn wrote to me about how #Trumpcare's #Medicaid cut could jeopardize her son's medical care. I will stand up for Isaac &amp; Kim! 
#FY18NDAA will strengthen our national security benefit Virginia‚Äôs hardworking defense community &amp; support servicemembers &amp; their families

I'll be discussing my bill that aims to stabilize &amp; improve the individual marketplace. This is a needed reform Ds &amp; Rs can agree on
Headed to the floor. It's clear the Senate must take this moment to work together on health care proposals for ALL Americans
Happy 100th birthday to Naval Station Norfolk! The largest naval base in the world &amp; critical part of Hampton Roads' defense community
.@MarkWarner and I are sending @AlexandriaVAPD &amp; the Capitol Police officers our Senate resolution honoring their heroic actions. Thank you 
Republicans should let the health committees debate health care proposals. Open up the process and let the sunlight in‚òÄÔ∏è
In Virginia 20% of Latinos are enrolled in #Medicaid. #Trumpcare slashes #Medicaid funding putting VA's Latino children at risk
In 2015 34% of Latinos relied on #Medicaid coverage. It plays a big role among Latino Americans who are low-income kids or in poor health
If Republicans repeal the ACA &amp; ram #Trumpcare through more than 6 million Latinos including 1 million children could lose coverage
Joined @SenCortezMasto &amp; @SenatorMenendez to discuss the effect #Trumpcare could have on our Latino communities 
Health care is not a political game. We're talking about people's lives. More from my op-ed in the @virginianpilot 
Bankruptcy has been reduced in America because of Obamacare. The Senate shouldn't rush this mean #Trumpcare bill through! 
This is not how the American people want us doing business on such an important issue in their lives: their health #PeopleOverPolitics 
Re-upping my offer to GOP from January: Drop the rush on a partisan bill &amp; deliberate w/Dems on ACA improvements. There is common ground!

Medicaid covers 3 in 10 Americans battling opioid addiction but #Trumpcare slashes funding &amp; puts millions at risk
#Trumpcare undermines the progress we‚Äôve made on #opioid epidemic by slashing #Medicaid
President Trump &amp; Republicans love to talk about ending the #opioid epidemic but their #Trumpcare bill will intensify the crisis
Senate GOP #Trumpcare bill would cut $1.4 billion in #Medicaid from VA - even more than unpopular House version. It targets kids &amp; seniors

I want to hear how #Trumpcare will affect you. Share your story using #AmericaSpeaksOut and tag me. Will RT.
No help from Dems? R's crafted a bill in secret w/no public hearings &amp; will skip committee review. Open up the process! #PeopleNotPolitics 
It's clear from Trump's own words that his intentions w/the travel ban are more about politics &amp; stoking fear than national security #SCOTUS
Why rush on health care? Why shut out the American public?  We need committee hearings #ProtectOurCare 
Looks like Senate GOP health care proposal shatters President Trump's promises to the American people on coverage &amp; costs 
Agreed. Senate Republicans need to listen and not rush this bill through. It will hurt too many people 
#EidMubarak to Muslims across the world!
Proud that Virginia is honoring the contributions of Native Americans with this new monument 
Listened to Virginians in #RVA yesterday who are worried about how #Trumpcare's #Medicaid cuts will affect them 
Last week in Cville I made a spontaneous @UVA pitch to a prospective student and now I've been made an honorary Virginia Guide! #Wahoowa! 
@GoDanRiver: Medicaid cuts could put Dan River Region schools in squeeze  
The Senate GOP health care bill places an #AgeTax on seniors forcing them to pay more for coverage. We can't stand for this
Cuts to #Medicaid in #Trumpcare puts funding that public schools use for student services at risk #ProtectMedicaid 
GOP Senators want to repeal Obamacare. American people reject #Trumpcare. if you want D's &amp; R's working together for 'Americare'
#Trumpcare would hurt seniors kids people with disabilities &amp; middle class families. Promised I'd stand up for them today in Richmond
Early Virginia reaction to #Trumpcare bill - our Republican state legislature deeply opposed to it. About to meet w/constituents in Richmond 
The #HealthcareBill is especially cruel to Virginians struggling with mental health &amp; substance use disorder
Senate GOP #HealthcareBill slashes #Medicaid--a program that nearly 1 million Virginians rely on the majority of them children
We need to have a meaningful discussion on the most important issue in people's lives: their health. Not a rushed GOP #HealthcareBill 
This Republican #HealthcareBill will hurt Virginians. Headed to the Senate floor now to speak about it
...Not rushing to pass a bill that would cause so much pain to so many people
What Congress should be doing: listening to constituents patients &amp; providers about how we can keep improving health care for everyone...
It weakens health benefits &amp; raises health costs for Virginia‚Äôs families at a time when we should be working to lower costs
It slashes #Medicaid &amp; hurts the 22000 Virginians who rely on @PPFA for health care
Senate Republican #HealthcareBill isn't just mean it's cruel
Senate GOP bill‚Äôs extreme Medicaid cuts would hurt Virginians &amp; break Trump promises all to deliver a giant tax break to the wealthiest
Senate Republicans kept their health care bill completely secret from the American people until the 11th hour and now we know why
Talked to @OKnox of @YahooNews for @SXMPOTUS on why I'm pressing Congress to show courage by debating &amp; voting on a new war authorization 
Another problem with #Trumpcare. It would undercut funding to Virginia communities combatting the opioid abuse epidemic 
War votes are supposed to be tough - that's part of our job description in Congress. It's time we debate &amp; vote on a new #AUMF 
If #Trumpcare passes the $156000 in #Medicaid reimbursements @TCPSchools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $314000 in #Medicaid reimbursements @HCPSNews has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $354000 in #Medicaid reimbursements @CvilleSchools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $641000 in #Medicaid reimbursements @RoanokeSchools &amp; @RkeCoSchools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.6 million  in #Medicaid reimbursements @vbschools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.8 million in #Medicaid reimbursements @NPSchools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.5 million in #Medicaid reimbursements @RPS_Schools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.4 million in #Medicaid reimbursements @HenricoSchools has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.9 million in #Medicaid reimbursements @fcpsnews has received could be in jeopardy
If #Trumpcare passes the $1.9 million in #Medicaid reimbursements @ACPSk12 has received could be in jeopardy
Here are some Virginia school districts that could lose federal #Medicaid reimbursements that supports students if #Trumpcare passes...
#Medicaid enables many kids to go to school plain and simple. #Trumpcare cuts it casting them aside for a tax break to the wealthy
In Virginia our children &amp; schools would be the largest demographic hurt by GOP plans to cut #Medicaid as part of #Trumpcare &amp; #TrumpBudget
Schools rely on #Medicaid to provide special ed classes &amp; health-related services such as vision exams and mental health evaluations
In most recent reporting years Virginia public schools received nearly $33 million in federal #Medicaid funding. #Trumpcare would cut it
Released a report on how #Trumpcare and #TrumpBudget #Medicaid cuts could take money from Virginia's public schools &amp; students 
As we combat the opioid epidemic important to note that #Trumpcare would undermine resources communities use to provide treatment 
While the ACA was openly debated for the American people to see the GOP has chosen to hide #Trumpcare from the public until the 11th hour 
Even @POTUS has said #Trumpcare is ‚Äúmean.‚Äù So why are Senate &amp; House Republicans still trying to pass it? 
Great to meet Virginians Amy and Evelin who will help throw out the first pitch at tomorrow's @CWSoftballGame! 
#RefugeesWelcome in our Commonwealth. Virginia has seen the positive contributions of refugees in our communities #WRD2017

Cutting Medicaid jeopardizes the ability of people to live with independence and dignity. We will not stand for this
#TrumpCare bill &amp; proposed budget cuts slash #Medicaid by $1.3 trillion. This deeply frightens Virginians I've heard from
Was just on the Senate floor urging GOP to #ShowUsTheBill. #TrumpCare would hurt VA seniors children and people w/disabilities
I'm headed to the floor now #ShowUsTheBill
Democrats are on the Senate floor ready to debate health care fixes. Where are Republicans and where is the bill? #ShowUsTheBill
Health care is the most important expenditure in our lives. Writing a bill in secret is unprecedented &amp; irresponsible #ShowUsTheBIll
if you think Senate Republicans should hold public hearings on #Trumpcare and #ShowUsTheBill
Los republicanos en el Senado no tendr√°n audiencias sobre #Trumpcare y ni siquiera nos quieren mostrar el proyecto de ley. ¬øQu√© esconden?
Senate Republicans won't hold hearings on #Trumpcare or even agree to #ShowUsTheBill. What are they hiding?
D's won't make it easy for R's to secretly hatch a plan to take health insurance away from 23 million people #ShowUsTheBill
Virginia lost a hero in Dakota Rigsby. Such a terrible incident and my heart is with all who loved him &amp; the families of everyone affected

@SenatorCarper This bill is a great place to start bipartisan collaboration on health care. It's a way we can improve affordability &amp; choices for consumers
The bill @SenatorCarper and I just intro'd would help Virginians by improving the health care marketplace &amp; lowering premiums

Comey's opening statement confirms a disturbing pattern of actions taken by the Trump Admin leading up to and after his firing #ComeyDay

@SenKamalaHarris: I asked Deputy AG Rosenstein to commit in writing that Mueller has full independence. The American people deserve it.‚Ä¶
Proud to call the Senior Senator from Virginia a friend and colleague. This is important work. 
Health care is most important expenditure in people‚Äôs lives. Why bypass health care committees? Senate should listen to patients &amp; providers 
Thanked my hardworking interns and our Senate pages today! They get a behind the scenes look at what it's like to work in the Senate 
Started my morning with @MarkWarner congratulating Virginians we &amp; others nominated for our nation's Service Academies. Impressive group!

Future Senator Matthew wrote me that if elected he'd vote for dogs to go to school. I bet some of my constituents could get behind that! 
Trump blames his small admin on D obstruction. But he hasn't found nominees for 80% of positions! Why? Working for him hurts your reputation 
Great decision. Virginians are ready to continue leading the clean energy revolution #ActOnClimate

POTUS jealous of Obama accomplishments. But in the end American innovative spirit is stronger than his insecurities
Why did Trump really walk away from #ParisAgreement? He's surrounded by science deniers and fossil fuel junkies
Congratulations Tejas. You made the Commonwealth proud! 
#LoveIsLove - Happy Pride Month to all #LGBT Americans #Pride2017
Trump alienates allies walks away from #ParisAgreement &amp; sabotages health care. His presidency is all destruction &amp; no accomplishments
I'm confident that our nation‚Äôs optimistic can-do spirit will prevail over this short-sighted dereliction of leadership #ParisAgreement
I reject the notion that this nation has to choose between our clean energy and economic goals #ParisAgreement
He seems to think a nation that won WWII and put men on the moon can't cut 1/4th of our carbon pollution by 2025 #ParisAgreement
Trump's decision to retreat from #ParisAgreement reflects an extraordinary lack of faith in American innovation
All in for Tejas from Glen Allen #VirginiaIsForSpellers

Devastating news from Kabul is a reminder of the risks to U.S. Afghan and Allied personnel supporting the ongoing struggle for peace. 
Eyes of history are upon you President Trump; for the sake of future generations I hope you make the right decision 
Real question: Why does Trump shred U.S. alliances and cozy up to dictators?
Trump poised to abandon the fight against climate change based on the request of 22 Republican Senators?
The United States backing out of Paris Climate Agreement would cede global leadership on science and clean energy. 
Honored to visit the @WJCLibrary today. It is a great tribute to two remarkable public servants 
We must stay committed to the #ParisAgreement. The world needs America‚Äôs leadership to combat the dangers posed by #climatechange
The #TrumpBudget eliminates programs that Virginia was using to support our cities &amp; towns. This will really hurt. 
Remembering all who have served our country &amp; made the ultimate sacrifice &amp; praying for all who have lost loved ones in service #MemorialDay

Amtrak funding is zeroed out under #TrumpBudget. 51% of Virginians would lose some or all of their passenger rail service
Proud to join my colleagues on a bill today to #RaiseTheWage to $15 by 2024 today
Raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give more than 41 million low-wage workers a raise. #RaiseTheWage 
if you believe no one in our country who works full-time should struggle to make ends meet. #RaiseTheWage

#CBOscore confirms that #Trumpcare is still full of Trump's #BrokenPromises. 23 million Americans would lose health insurance
@ALALibrary: Thank you @timkaine for signing the #LSTA Dear Appropriator letter + for supporting libraries in #Virginia #SaveIMLS
The #TrumpBudget confirms where @POTUS's priorities lie: he wants to dismantle critical programs that support Virginia's families
In Virginia 20% of residents in rural areas rely on Medicaid coverage. #Trumpcare would make it harder for them to afford critical care
#RuralHealth Fact: #Trumpcare strips $839 billion from #Medicaid which hurts rural hospitals
#Trumpcare = 2.9MIL Americans losing access to #RuralHealth care by 2020
@realDonaldTrump Pres Trump's 1st budget: 1.3 trillion cut in Medicaid 72 billion cut to Social Security Disability #TrumpBudget #BrokenPromises
".@realDonaldTrump: ""I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid."""
VAWA funds services for survivors of sexual assault &amp; domestic violence. Also provides resources to law enforcement to combat these crimes

AG Sessions' criminal justice policy creates more problems &amp; reverses the bipartisan progress made under Obama. I strongly oppose 
Our bill promotes up-front investment in resilient infrastructure to withstand recurrent flooding in Hampton Roads 
A very concerning study. More reason to speed up work on strategies to address recurrent flooding in Hampton Roads 
Trump's budget slashes $1 billion in funding for #CareerTechEd programs. This would hurt our ability to fill jobs and close the skills gap
Medicaid provides over 186000 people with disabilities in Virginia access to critical services that helps them live independently
Nearly 113000 of Virginia's seniors get care through #Medicaid including nursing home care and services to live at home
Over 549000 of Virginia's kids get health care through #Medicaid
Over one million Virginians get quality health coverage through #Medicaid. Most are children seniors and people with disabilities
#Medicaid works in Virginia. Here's the proof and why President Trump should not slash the program...
Pres Trump ignored concerns raised by Virginians &amp; local organizations over these cuts all to pay for a huge tax cut for the wealthy
Trump's budget would be devastating for Virginia‚Äôs families children seniors businesses the poor....the list goes on and on
"This attack is sickening and the world stands united with Manchester. ""We'll Never Die!"""
Though a positive step DHS extension of Haitian refugee program is only a temporary fix. The Administration must do more
Talked w/ folks today @MACH37cyber an accelerator that supports cyber companies. We must make advances in #cybersecurity &amp; tech innovation 
Displaced Haitians have faced incredible hardship since the 2010 earthquake. Glad DHS extended this program to help refugees 
We‚Äôre talking about real people‚Äôs health. 90-day extension creates more chaos &amp; premium increases. @POTUS &amp; GOP are sabotaging health care 
Looking forward to Mr. Comey's testimony before the Senate. Understanding his perspective is long overdue. I'm tired of the WH spin.
.@POTUS must reconsider. Terrible move to further destabilize health insurance raising rates &amp; reducing options. Stop the health care chaos 
"You can always be candid with your friends!  Pres Trump reassures Russians that ""pressure ...is off"" after firing Comey. Nightmare. "

No challenge is too great for your fighting spirit to overcome! Know you have the love and support of all of your friends 
Very troubling when our close allies lose confidence in us b/c the President hands classified info to an adversary 
POTUS leak to Russia is just the latest in a long line of rash decisions that make America less safe 
You shared classified intel with our adversary at the likely expense of our allies &amp; intel community. Inexcusable. 
Thankful to hear from law enforcement local leaders teachers &amp; parents who are working together to prevent gang violence in our community 
Shocking actions for any American President but sadly unsurprising coming from President Trump. 
These programs offer students great opportunities &amp; I'll continue to advocate for expanding CTE programs in Virginia &amp; across the country

The country deserves a special prosecutor now to get to the bottom of Trump / Russia connections
U.S. doesn't need a President undermining law enforcement or Trump Administration officials lying
"Acting FBI director McCabe confirms Russia investigation ""highly significant."""

Great meeting @sashadigiulian today! A powerful role model &amp; advocate for the outdoors. Plus...she's a Virginian! 
After fighting for the release of this brave Virginian it's an honor to meet with Aya Hijazi and welcome her and her husband back home 
The story keeps changing. Underscores the urgent need for special prosecutor &amp; Comey / Rosenstein / Sessions to testify in Congress 
#Trumpcare would devastate American families. About to speak on the floor about why we need a meaningful Senate debate to #ProtectOurCare
#Trumpcare undermines women's health care access. I stand with @NARAL against this terrible bill 
I'm looking forward to hearing from Virginian Michael Dunkley who will testify about his concerns with #Trumpcare #AmericaSpeaksOut
How will #Trumpcare affect you?  Share your story using the hashtag #AmericaSpeaksOut
Tune in LIVE at 2:30pm as @SenateDems hear from people across the U.S including VA who would be hurt by #Trumpcare 
Pattern is clear. Special prosecutor needed
FBI Director Comey fired by Trump as bureau pursues investigation into Trump/Russia ties
AG Sessions misleads Senate Committee about his contacts with Russia--has to recuse himself
NSA Flynn fired by Trump once public reports surface about his extensive Russia contacts
Deputy AG Yates fired by Trump after telling WH that NSA Flynn compromised by/lying about Russia
Trump despidiendo a Comey demuestra el miedo de la Administraci√≥n sobre la investigaci√≥n de Rusia
Comey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to cover-up the truth
Comey firing recommended by Sessions. I thought he had recused himself from Russia investigation!
Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation
Teachers play a tremendous role in our children‚Äôs lives just like the @RPS_Schools teachers who taught my kids! #NationalTeachersDay

Joining Chris &amp; Alisyn tomorrow morning on @NewDay at 7:30am to discuss #AHCA &amp; the health care chaos President Trump has created
Congrats to VA @MineWorkers &amp; my old friend President Cecil Roberts for winning the fight for miners' health care. Glad to stand with you 
Pres Trump promised the American people no one would lose coverage or pay more. We should never accept this bill that breaks both promises
If House GOP cared about health care they would care about how this bill affects people's health. Millions will lose their health care
Here‚Äôs what we do know: tens of millions expected to lose care &amp; people w/pre-existing conditions would lose protections &amp; face rising costs
House is rushing this vote. They don't want you to know about roll back of pre-ex conditions coverage or how many millions would lose care
Your voices made the difference last time. Call your House members this morning and tell them to #VoteNoAHCA
After Trump nominates SecEd who doesn't understand federal disability law now TrumpCare bill would cut special ed services. Heartless!

Aetna leaving VA marketplace is painful real-life consequence of Pres Trump playing politics with health care &amp; causing uncertainty
I've offered to work together to improve ACA but the House needs to stop pursuing a bill opposed by patients providers &amp; stakeholders.
Here‚Äôs what the GOP plan for under-funded high risk pools means: waiting lists expensive premiums &amp; no pre-existing conditions protections
GOP claim that $8B TrumpCare amendment will protect people w/ pre-existing conditions is false. Costs would spike people would be hurt
The @washingtonpost ed board is right. GOP is sabotaging the ACA at expense of millions of Americans‚Äô health care 
Hey Coach I agree. Speaking on the Senate floor today at 12:30pm on why America shouldn't cut funding in legal aid #LSCmatters @LSCtweets

The budget dilemma was created by Trump Admin convincing Rs to not pass a full year budget last Dec. Amateur hour! 
After #Trump100days it should be clear--stop trying to repeal Obamacare &amp; be a Pres who brings Ds &amp; Rs together to improve health for all
Trump promised $1 billion infrastructure plan &amp; VA roads bridges &amp; rail could use it. POTUS should come to us &amp; work together #Trump100Days

Thanks @RepMcCaul for introducing our bipartisan #cyber scholarships bill in the House. This bill is a win for job training &amp; #cybersecurity 
The American people like the ACA and want their reps to work to make it even better. After #Trump100Days the president should listen
"In #Trump100days he went from ""insurance for everybody"" to working to undermine the ACA hurting American families. More #BrokenPromises"
GOP health care bill still kicks millions of people off their plans. We should be working on bipartisan ACA improvements
Thank you! Look forward to working with Amb @GERONIMO__GF to continue strengthening the important ties between the US and #Mexico! 
"President Trump's tax ""plan"" is short on details. Any tax reform must prioritize small businesses &amp; middle class families"
This indicates that he sees no value in these sacred places except perhaps in resources drilled fracked or mined from them
President Trump's EO on National Monuments - which could affect Fort Monroe in Hampton VA - is short-sighted &amp; wrong!

1000+ people in Hampton Roads and countless more in VA rely on @_MealsOnWheels. I'll work to stop these budget cuts 
Spent some time with the family behind @2witchesbrew last night in Danville! A cool place with some great craft brews 
"""Why is this night different from all other nights?"" Happy Passover!"
Vote for Jenn! VA is lucky to have her as a leader. And I'm proud to call her my friend. 
Heard from business leaders &amp; community investors worried Pres Trump's budget would hurt projects like theirs by eliminating critical funds 
Spent time with Mayor Foster in Lynchburg today to discuss their economic development &amp; downtown investment 
Saddened by the attacks in Egypt this morning on worshipers gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday
I'll be on #MTP this morning discussing Syria &amp; why President Trump must get authorization from Congress to use military action 
Wishing @VSUTrojans @_HamptonU &amp; @VAUnion1865 best of luck at the #HCASC national tournament!
Hanging with Mech Tech Dragons at First Robotics District Championship at VCU. STEM rocks! @FIRSTweets 
From the nation's capital to the Colonial Capital: Congrats to W&amp;M President &amp; war powers expert Taylor Reveley on his announced retirement 
Time for the President to follow the Constitution! Time for Congress to do its job!
"Quoting citizen Donald Trump in 2013: ""The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria--big mistake if he does not."""
2001 AUMF doesn't give legal authority for the airstrikes in Syria. It was drafted for military actions vs 9/11 terrorists
Trump Administration has escalated ground combat in Syria and now air strikes against a Syrian airbase. All without Congress
Assad is a brutal dictator who must be held account for atrocities. But the President's failure to seek congressional approval is unlawful
President waging military action against Syria without a vote of Congress? Unconstitutional.
VA miners with black lung disease should not face obstacles to securing health benefits. Reintroduced a bill to reform this program 
Bannon's removal from the NSC was necessary and way past due. His role caused concern in VA and among national security experts 
Stopped by the 5th annual Chesapeake Bay Day lunch. With potential Trump budget cuts looming we must fight harder than ever to #SaveTheBay 
@NARAL: Thank you @timkaine for standing up for #reprofreedom &amp; highlighting why we must #StopGorsuch! #WeObject! 
Judge Gorsuch has taken an activist approach to cases impacting women's health. Headed to the Senate floor soon to share why I'm voting no
Wrote an op-ed for @CNN about how Judge Gorsuch shows a troubling pattern on cases involving women's health 
#GoJeffGo
President Trump signed away your #BroadbandPrivacy. A disservice to American consumers &amp; our right to privacy
Another war crime in Syria - use of poison gas against civilians. We must hold Assad accountable and protect civilians!
A look at the impact of the #GenderPayGap in Virginia #EqualPayDay 
The #GenderPayGap hurts families &amp; their ability to climb the economic ladder. Joining @PattyMurray to call for #EqualPay today
It is unacceptable that a woman in Virginia will lose $482000 on average over a 40-year career compared to a man #EqualPayDay
In Virginia on average a woman would have to work until she is 71 years old to make what a man makes by the time he is 60 #EqualPayDay
Love stopping by places like Mason Dixon cafe where old friends can get together for a good laugh and a great lunch 
Gathered local biz leaders and Fredericksburg city officials at the @FredRegChamber to discuss econ development &amp; transportation challenges
Annual Equality VA dinner reinvigorates our commitment to advancing equality for LGBT Virginians. Glad to see so many friendly faces tonight
2 days in Valley ends w/ stop in Staunton @ VinylFest 2017-cool folks gathering to listen to entire Kinks Katalogue. I brought refreshments! 
.@POTUS I'm going to do everything I can to stop that from happening and see to it that our communities have the tools to succeed (2/2)
With elimination of ARC EDA USDA rural water funding and Community Development Block grants @POTUS would leave rural VA behind (1/2)
Glad to be in Roanoke for @vademocrats' Rural Dem retreat to talk issues impacting rural Virginia including Trump's budget
@codeorg: Thank you Senator @timkaine &amp; @SenatorWicker for introducing bipartisan legislation for cyber security education. 
No valid reason for GOP to deny 400000 low-income Virginians health care. Read @GovernorVA on Medicaid expansion: 
Got an update on Staunton Crossing from Mayor Carolyn Dull. Pres Trump's budget could hurt future projects like this 
The work volunteers like Glenda do with @_MealsOnWheels makes a huge impact on seniors in the Valley 
Loved stopping by Jake's on my way into town. Owner Rhonda lost her son in Iraq and is the epitome of perseverance. 
Pretty cool to sign my name on the wall in Waynesboro's Wayne Theatre. Their program receives NEA funding that would be cut in Trump budget. 
War in Middle East continues to expand &amp; Congress refuses to debate an AUMF. This must change w/new Admin in place 
Agree w/@madeleine. A war authorization debate by Congress informs the public &amp; demonstrates seriousness of sending our troops into battle
Planned Parenthood provides critical health services to women &amp; targeting its funding will undermine care #StandWithPP 
Met Aya Hijazi‚Äôs brother Basel to discuss her case. I assured him that VA is working hard to #FreeAya &amp; to finally welcome her back home 
This jeopardizes the #BroadbandPrivacy of Virginians &amp; Pres Trump should veto. Customers are entitled to privacy 
@BobbyScott: Thx @GOPoversight &amp; @OversightDems for marking up the 400 yrs of African American History Commission Act introduced by me‚Ä¶
Today and every day I‚Äôm proud to #StandWithPP and the 2.5 million who rely on their care and services #PinkOut
Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs selective activism in restricting women‚Äôs rights is jarring &amp; doesn't demonstrate a philosophy that belongs on #SCOTUS
He has argued bosses have an individual right to prevent their company's female employees from using health insurance to buy contraception
He has cavalierly referred to contraceptive use - a constitutionally protected right for 50+ yrs - as ‚Äòthe wrongdoing of others.‚Äô
Judge Gorsuch has taken an activist approach to cases involving a woman‚Äôs right to make her own health decisions
After meeting with Judge Gorsuch &amp; studying his past decisions I've decided to oppose his nomination. Full statement: 
Met with VA @AIPAC members today to discuss how together we can work toward peace in the region and protect Israel's security 
Our energy strategy should be getting cleaner tomorrow than today. Disappointed @POTUS is breaking his promise to promote clean air &amp; water
We can make health care better by lowering costs improving the stability of the markets &amp; expanding access. GOP &amp; Dems must work together
The #ACA is working and I hope Republicans will join us to improve the law and health care coverage for all Americans
Headed to #AIPAC2017! Excited to intro a video on @RichmondBallet's Minds in Motion Israel partnership. Watch live: 
#Medicaid expansion in VA is way overdue - would increase access to health care for nearly 400000. Support @GovernorVA's push for a vote
Weekend read. As war against ISIS escalates Congress can't continue to ignore its constitutional role in war powers 
"President on #TrumpCare failure: ""we didn't have one Democrat."" They never asked! D's have ideas to lower drug costs improve health care."
Offer still stands 
Today‚Äôs #TrumpCare failure would not have happened if not for the energetic activism of the American people! üëè
Visited w/ parents at @_CHKD who voiced fears over what cuts to Medicaid would mean for families of almost 600k kids in VA who depend on it 
President Trump in January: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have insurance for everybody...much less expensive and much better.‚Äù
Thank you VCCS for pulling together admin &amp; staff for a critical conversation on improving the quality of ed for military &amp; veteran students
"President Trump: ""Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."""
New CBO score confirms what we‚Äôve always known on #TrumpCare. It covers less raises costs &amp; is still one big tax break for the wealthiest
@UFCW400: True fact: you can meet with your senators and they will listen to you. #400lobbyday 
Thanked VA representatives of @UFCW400 for the hard work they do to keep our country running 
GOP should take this opportunity to abandon #TrumpCare that would harm millions sit down with Dems &amp; talk seriously about improving the ACA
#TrumpCare eliminar√≠a la expansi√≥n de #Medicaid y le quitar√≠a la cobertura que 3.2 millones de latinos obtuvieron con la #ACA
#TrumpCare le quitar√° cobertura m√©dica a muchos de los 4 millones de adultos y m√°s de 600mil ni√±os latinos que obtuvieron cobertura con #ACA
#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it not break it!
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion &amp; dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid
#TrumpCare would double the number of uninsured people under the age of 65
The #ACA has insured over 20 million Americans in 7 years while #TrumpCare stands to leave 24 million fewer people with health care
It's the 7th anniversary of the #AffordableCareAct today and we must protect this law that's helped millions of Americans
VA's seniors can't afford #TrumpCare. We should be working to lower prescription drug costs for them not unfairly increasing their premiums
#TrumpCare still includes the Republican Age Tax and people in their 50s and 60s will still see costs rise significantly
#TrumpCare would result in an approximate $3200 monthly premium increase for the average 64 year old
#TrumpCare allows insurers to charge older adults 5x what they charge younger adults. This means higher costs for older Americans
America stands by the UK's side. Thinking of our friends in London today in the aftermath of this tragic attack
Chesapeake Bay Program has been good for VA's environment &amp; economy. Pres Trump's budget breaks promise cuts funding for Bay #WorldWaterDay
Grateful for #SCOTUS ruling in Endrew F. All students ‚Äì including those with disabilities ‚Äì have the right to the best education possible
.@SenateGOP wants corporations not consumers to control personal information. Join me in standing up to protect #BroadbandPrivacy
I agree. We owe it to our troops and allies. Congress has abdicated this fundamental part of our job for far too long 
#TrumpCare would hurt efforts to end the opioid crisis. Jeopardizes coverage for 2.8 million suffering from substance use disorders
Proud to join you in this effort. Will address challenges I've heard directly about from women veterans in Virginia 
@MarkWarner: w/ @timkaine on call w/ Va. hospitals on #Trumpcare: 232k in Va. lose coverage/$209m unpaid hospital charges. This is NOT a‚Ä¶
VA Indian tribes have played a major role in US history &amp; the fabric of our nation. They deserve federal recognition 
Started off my morning with econ students from Alexandria's @TCWTitans. Left side! Strong side! 
Repealing ACA would upend lives in VA and nationwide. @GOPHELP should postpone other policy discussions focus on #TrumpCare
Nowruz Mubarak to those celebrating in Virginia and across the world
My tour of #SafeTrack work in VA made it clear now isn‚Äôt the time to increase Metro's maintenance backlog with POTUS budget cuts to DOT DHS 
Glad I could add to the discussion today and thanks for hosting me! 
Thank you Mr. Bennington for inviting me to join his 12th grade Gov class at @KettleRunNews. Fun talking branches of govt with fresh minds! 
Honored to speak at the 2017 Carnegie International Nuclear Policy Conference. Watch live at 11:50 @CarnegieEndow

Happy #StPatricksDay!
My bracket may be busted but I got to meet #MarchMadness sensation @StephenCurry30 today as a consolation! 
And congrats to my hometown team @VCU_Hoops on their great season &amp; 7th consecutive NCAA appearance! @VCURamNation
Congratulations to @TeamCoachBuzz and @VT_MBBALL on a greatseason. Can‚Äôt wait for next year!
.@POTUS budget cuts would cause harm in every corner of Virginia:
I‚Äôm ready to work w/ colleagues across the aisle on a realistic budget that charts a different path &amp; helps Virginians get ahead.
And taking taxpayer dollars away from these VA priorities to pay for Pres Trump‚Äôs wall ‚Äì which won‚Äôt make us safer - is not an option.
A 13.5% cut to the Department of Education threatens our public schools putting our teachers and students at risk
The $4.7 B cut to the @USDA could jeopardize research investments at land-grant universities like @Virginia_Tech &amp; @NorfolkStateU
The $2.4 B cut to @USDOT could jeopardize efforts we have in place to reduce the Metro maintenance backlog
.@POTUS budget would eliminate Chesapeake Bay Program funding (despite promising clean water 2 weeks ago) hurting environment &amp; VA economy
Drastic cuts threaten programs VA relies on for clean water safe roads well-funded public schools and quality affordable health care.
Despite investments in defense these budget cuts show me @POTUS is continuing to push policies that would hurt Virginians
About to share my takeaways from President Trump‚Äôs budget and its potential impact on Virginia families‚Ä¶
Good luck to Virginia's college basketball teams competing in #MarchMadness today. Make VA proud!
Proud to join @PattyMurray on this bill that will lift up working families in Virginia 
We can‚Äôt ignore uptick in threats &amp; crimes against religious/racial minorities &amp; LGBTQ Americans. We need to combat hate crimes #NoHateAct
Met with @VOICEVirginia about the fear Trump policies have caused in Northern Virginia's vibrant immigrant communities
Intro'd a bipartisan resolution calling for peace and accountability in Syria with @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio &amp; @ChrisMurphyCT today 
On 6th anniversary of Syrian civil war we must work harder to protect innocent lives &amp; support all efforts to restore peace to the region
@VT_MBBall: Good looking out @timkaine üëå 
My #MarchMadness bracket this year! Being bold and calling on #HokieNation to pull off the upset 
@senrobportman: Introduced a bill w/@timkaine today to help make sure our kids are job-ready on graduation day by supporting #CTE:
Trump Administration hasn't submitted names for Senate consideration for 50+ vacancies at DOD. Isn't national security a priority?
More people would be uninsured under #TrumpCare than at any other time in our history: 
"When the White House labels facts they don‚Äôt like as ""fake news"" they open the door for others to do the same "
Monitoring the storm. Stay safe Virginia! Tips for how to prepare here: 
POTUS said no one will lose coverage under an ACA repeal. #TrumpCare shatters that promise all to deliver a massive tax cut to the wealthy
CBO report confirms our fears about #TrumpCare. 24 million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 under this bill
Restrictions &amp; drastic cost increases for women‚Äôs health care services hurt our families and our economy #TrumpCare: 
Rural America would be hurt by #TrumpCare. Largest increase in costs will affect the poor and elderly: 
#TrumpCare is one big tax cut (hundreds of billions of $$) for the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class 
I‚Äôll keep working to protect VA's federal employees. Great visit today to FCC Petersburg &amp; then lunch at Captain Tom's with @AFGENational 
Had breakfast this morning at Brewer's Caf√© with Owner AJ Brewer LG @RalphNortham and friends for #blackrestaurantweek in #RVA 
.@SenatorRounds and I want to expand scholarships so that our #cyber workforce is stronger and can meet growing 21st century challenges 
POTUS said Mexico would pay but now plans to take $$ from counterterrorism &amp; airport security instead. We won't stand for this. #NoBanNoWall 
#Trumpcare is one big tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. Heading to the floor now to speak about my serious concerns
Without women my Senate office wouldn't be able to do our important work on behalf of Virginians #DayWithoutWomen
I'm wearing red today to honor the commitments women have made to our workforce &amp; their contributions to society #DayWithoutWomen #IWD2017
#Trumpcare doesn‚Äôt fix health care. It's a tax cut for the very wealthy. How much of a tax cut would Trump family get under this bill?
#Trumpcare drives up costs for patients but cuts the Tanning Tax . . . interesting ü§î
#Trumpcare will cut taxes on the very wealthy making average Americans pay more
Young ppl in the pool bring costs down for everyone. So why is #Trumpcare creating a 30% lapsed-coverage surcharge? It's a #MillenialPenalty
Reviewing #Trumpcare. Cuts @PPFA funds hurting millions of women who go there for mammograms maternity care cancer screenings &amp; more
Pay inequality costs AAPI women thousands of $$ over a lifetime. Families deserve economic security. #AAPIEqualPay
And the GOP is pushing the repeal and replace #Trumpcare bill through before the cost and coverage losses can be predicted. Terrible.
House health care bill would cause uncertainty in people's lives &amp; economy defund PP &amp; dismantle #Medicaid. I'll strongly oppose #Trumpcare
Optimistic that Richmond-based 4th Circuit will continue to stand for fair treatment for all including transgender students #StandWithGavin
POTUS urged Russia to cyber hack Hillary &amp; then invents wiretap claim? Must focus on real issue: Trump campaign &amp; Admin contacts w/ Russia
The Trump Administration's immigration orders ‚Äì after weeks of unnecessary confusion ‚Äì remain a mess. More about politics than about safety 
Standing with cancer patients their families &amp; survivors - including Chnoic from Midlothian who shared her story w/ me today #TNBCDay
Heard powerful #ACA stories in Midlothian today. This law saves lives and I'm fighting to #ProtectOurCare 
I‚Äôm proud to #StandWithGavin and transgender equality. Discrimination has no place in our Commonwealth or country 
On the road to Midlothian after a delicious lunch at Queens Way Soul Cafe in Hampton! Pictured here with the owner Roger 
Convened VA Jewish community leaders on a call to express support in the wake of vandalism at cemeteries &amp; threats against schools &amp; JCCs 
These military spouses are a resilient bunch. Looking forward to sharing their policy ideas w/my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee 
Military families are at the core of VA's identity. In Hampton discussing unique employment healthcare &amp; education challenges for #milfams 
Voted NO on Rick Perry. He's denied climate science &amp; was unaware that the largest DOE function is managing U.S. nuclear assets
AG Sessions must publicly explain his misleading testimony to Judic Cmte. If his answers are not satisfactory I'll call for his resignation
AG Sessions must heed bipartisan calls to recuse himself. He is too compromised to guarantee objectivity and independence
Proud VA is #3 nationally for Peace Corps volunteers.  Thanks to those current volunteers and alumni who chose to serve #PCW2017
Met with @PPFAVirginia &amp; @PPMW_DC today. #IStandWithPP &amp; I'll be a strong voice against attempts to cut funding for women's health services 
Wishing fellow Christians a reflective start to #Lent on #AshWednesday
Pres Trump's words only matter tonight if he sticks to promises he lays out. First month of actions have caused worry in VA #JointAddress
Proud to have Leesburg's Shannon Linford join me for #JointAddress. She like millions of others would be denied health care without the #ACA 
Wave of bomb threats to JCCs &amp; schools across US including Gesher Jewish Day School in Fairfax. We must stand strong against anti-Semitism
Look forward to delivering keynote address at the #jst2017 conference gala tonight. Speaking soon - watch live here: 
Thank you Katherine Johnson for opening up the skies and introducing us to a world beyond our own. #Oscars

I support clean air &amp; water &amp; #ClimateAction! Proud to earn 100% on @LCVoters' 2016 #LCVScorecard. Find out more: 
A moment this Catholic will never forget. So humbled to meet @pontifex to discuss efforts to address the global refugee crisis 
Working hard to #SaveTheACA b/c a repeal would be a disaster for VA. Shared Virginians' stories in an @RTDNEWS op-ed 
Thanks to @SpeakerHowell for his service. We worked to preserve open space &amp; ban smoking in restaurants &amp; bars to improve public health
Happy President's Day! Anne &amp; I went cycling on the VA Capital Trail yesterday. Colonial Revolutionary War War of 1812 &amp; Civil War history 
Thank you to members of Indivisible Richmond's organizing committee for sharing your concerns and thoughts with me this morning 
Hosted a community forum in Newport News with @BobbyScott on civil rights &amp; our efforts to #SaveTheACA 
My wife Anne has a passion for education &amp; helping Virginia's children succeed. Proud to see her appointed to VA Board of Education!
Requesting ICE provide more details about the raid near an Alexandria church shelter 
Proud to work w/@MarkWarner on a bill to ease undue burdens on rural hospitals providing care to Virginians: 
Honored to host African American leaders from across Virginia for coffee donuts and discussion this morning during #BlackHistoryMonth 
Estoy de acuerdo con @SenatorMenendez. Inmigrantes hacen nuestro pa√≠s m√°s fuerte y forman parte de nuestra vida diaria #DayWithoutImmigrants 
Sea level rise threatens Hampton Roads communities &amp; our naval power. EPA must be able to accept #climatechange and work to address it in VA
Pruitt's record says whenever EPA has a menu of options he'll choose the one best for polluters not public health. That's why I'm voting no
From Norfolk to DC I hear you loud &amp; clear. I'll always continue fighting for immigrant rights #DayWithoutImmigrants 
Honored to host a special D.C. screening of @HiddenFigures with @MarkWarner to promote women in #STEM. An inspiring VA story of perseverance 
Proud to have a Governor who will fight to protect women's health care access #IStandWithPP 
Thanks to all who helped us shine a spotlight on the record of Andrew Puzder. Now let's find a Labor Secretary who supports working people!
Outrageous. The American people deserve an independent &amp; transparent investigation. 
Don't underestimate the power of making your voices heard. Thank you to these members of Indivisible for coming to my Manassas office! 
This #Appalachiantrail hiker thanks @AT_Conservancy for protecting such a beautiful mountain range for Virginians &amp; other AT lovers!
Watch leaders in #CareerTechEd discuss how CTE has evolved since first federal investment 100 years ago #CTEMonth 
Over the past 32 years my wonderful wife has been the best partner I could have hoped for. Happy #ValentinesDay Anne! 
To protect our country we need an independent bipartisan &amp; transparent investigation into Trump Admin &amp; campaign contact w/ Russia
The #FlynnResignation cements worst fears of many Americans &amp; our allies about connections b/t this Administration and the Kremlin
Good news. Freedom from discrimination on the basis of religion is in the First Amendment for a reason 
Dr. Shulkin has the experience to help improve timely access to care for veterans in VA &amp; across the U.S. as Veterans Affairs Secretary 
Pres Trump pledged to drain the swamp &amp; advocate for working people but his nomination of Mnuchin just amounts to another broken promise
I'm not confident Steven Mnuchin will be an advocate for working families &amp; their financial security. Will oppose his nomination today
Surprise of the weekend: meeting KC Hall of Famer George Brett at @GeorgeMasonU. Only player to win batting titles in 3 decades! #GoRoyals 
Do Congress Courts Press and Citizenry work to check an executive gone wild? Stay tuned...
The Trump Presidency is a 230 year check-up of our constitutional democracy
Promised NoVa women's health providers I'll fight efforts to repeal #ACA &amp; defund PP that hurt women's access to basic health care needs 
#ACA has helped countless in VA's Latino community. Discussed ways to improve &amp; #SaveTheACA with VA Latino leaders yesterday 
Some great questions and motivation from an immigration town hall w/ @GeorgeMasonU community last night! 
Pleased the #9thCircuit made the right decision to keep the un-American discriminatory #MuslimBan on hold
Happy birthday to @GovernorVa! Our Commonwealth is lucky to have you!
ACA has helped many VA families. Speaking against nomination of ACA opponent Tom Price by sharing VA stories. Tune to CSPAN2 #SaveTheACA
"I believe the constitutional duty to ""advise and consent"" on nominations should allow full debate #ShePersisted #LetLizSpeak"
Speaking on floor against the nomination of Jeff Sessions at 5pm. I do not have confidence in his ability to be a champion for civil rights
Congrats @JeffMBourne my new delegate in the @VaHouse! #RVA
Final #DAPL approval particularly concerning given @POTUS &amp; Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry's longstanding ties to builder
.@JeffMBourne's school board experience makes him the right person to represent #RVA in the @VaHouse. Polls open until 7PM-go vote Richmond!
Joining colleagues voicing opposition to #DeVos on Senate floor at 3am. VA students &amp; families deserve a champion of public ed! #NoOnDeVos
President Trump rolls back Dodd-Frank and regulations protecting retirees. He's not draining the swamp he's draining people's pockets!
Many judges now restraining President Trump's immigration orders. Mr. President -- don't attack judges fix your bad policy!
At our annual retreat at @MountVernon. Greatest Senate staff ever. Go Team Kaine! 
Troubling news given Putin's history of silencing opposition and Vladimir Kara-Murza's previous poisoning 
Defender of #DisabilityRights Sen. Tom Harkin &amp; I agree: if Betsy #DeVos won't defend #IDEA she can't lead @usedgov 
If Scott Pruitt rejects science on climate change I suspect he will ignore other science as well. I will oppose him full statement below 
But now Trump Admin paves way for a reversal that helps Big Oil &amp; allows corruption in poor resource-cursed countries. Senate must resist
ExxonMobil fought to stop passage of anti-corruption rule in 2010. They lost transparency won. Rule was enacted by EU and Canada
One day after Tillerson's approval House is gutting an anti-corruption rule requiring oil companies to disclose payments to foreign govts!
I opposed Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State because I questioned his ability to put U.S. interests above ExxonMobil
Virginia is stronger because of the immeasurable contributions of African Americans #BlackHistoryMonth
Happy birthday to my better half and the love of my life Anne. Thanks for making me smile and being by my side 
I will oppose Sen. Sessions's nomination. We need an AG who will protect civil rights &amp; reject torture. Full statement here 
My full statement on President Trump's Supreme Court announcement 
I intend to carefully scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's temperament and record particularly on civil rights and other Constitutional guarantees
I've known @RepMcEachin for more than 30 years &amp; I couldn't be happier to serve Virginia alongside him in Congress 
Strongly support Virginia's decision to stand up to this harmful policy and fight for our values in the courts 
Front pages in VA today highlight local impact of President Trump's #MuslimBan. Such a harmful policy does reverberate outside the Beltway 
Elaine Chao was a mainstream pick w/experience. Look forward to working with her to address Virginia's transportation infrastructure needs
Mick Mulvaney has supported sequestration debt ceiling showdowns &amp; unfair targeting of federal employees ‚Äì all policies that hurt Virginia
As a former mayor &amp; fair housing lawyer HUD has a big impact on poor communities. Concerned about Dr Carson‚Äôs commitment to this mission
This week I announced I'll vote NO on Ben Carson and Mick Mulvaney. More decisions on nominations coming soon
Today is the #ACA deadline so #GetCovered now! Visit  for more information
Voted NO on #DeVos in HELP. Very concerned about her views on public schools &amp; civil rights. Students parents &amp; teachers deserve better
The #MuslimBan is truly indefensible. Thank you for standing up against this 
Joining Democratic colleagues outside Supreme Court to speak out on Pres Trump's un-American #MuslimBan. Watch here: 
Just left Dulles - thanked lawyers &amp; Virginians doing critically important work &amp; making sure it's clear: #RefugeesWelcome
Unacceptable lack of public guidance on immigration order from @DHSgov. Secretary Kelly we urge you to provide immediate clarity. 
My casework team was in contact w/attorneys at Dulles through the night. Will keep doing all we can to assist detained travelers #noban
If we turn our backs on widows and orphans fleeing the very evil we despise we do not defeat our enemies; we surrender to them
I am appalled by the cruelty the Trump Administration has demonstrated over the past 24 hours
WH may not want you to know how to get #ACA coverage before open enrollment ends 1/31 but I do! #GetCovered today 
Our adversaries are waging a new information war and America needs a new comprehensive strategy to fight back: 
Puzder yet to submit ethics &amp; financial forms. Would he hire someone who can't get an application in on time? U.S. workers deserve to know
Not the @TheOnion 
Thank you to the thousands reaching out to my offices to share opinions &amp; concerns. Very high call volume so we appreciate your patience!

The JOBS Act a bipartisan bill @senrobportman &amp; I just introduced will help workers &amp; employers succeed in today's economy
Fields like cybersecurity are critical to our economy &amp; our national security yet good well-paying jobs in those areas are going unfilled
My full statement is here: 
I am disappointed President Trump didn't nominate someone who could champion these core principles for our families &amp; children
I will oppose Betsy DeVos‚Äôs nomination. Our next Education Secretary must be pro-public schools pro-accountability and pro-civil rights
@DeptofDefense: From refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes the fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out.htt‚Ä¶
Pres. Trump increasing jobs in one industry already ‚Äì fact checkers! #GimmeSomeTruth 
An across the board hiring freeze of federal workers hurts veterans &amp; seniors. We can't make fed employees a political punching bag 
Proud of my mom marching in Sante Fe and my sister-in-law and my three nieces marching in Kansas City #womensmarch #stateofwomen 
Trump's first executive order? Raising mortgage payments for low &amp; middle income homeowners. Not very populist!  
I'm still a strong man proud to stand behind strong women. March hard today! #womensmarch #stateofwomen
Hitched! Congrats to Dea and Sharon. Was honored to officiate their wedding tonight 
President Sullivan has served UVA admirably. Wishing her the best as she finishes her hard work! 
Voted in favor of Gen. Kelly. Confident he will bring a measured approach &amp; perspective to @DHSgov
As I continue to advocate for the interests of Virginia in the Senate my motto remains: advance everywhere we can defend everything we must
Congrats Pres. Trump &amp; VP Pence. I wish them the best as they take on this monumental duty &amp; hope they will be successful for all Americans
The peaceful transfer of power remains one of the most powerful symbols of our great democracy
My statement on the nominations of Nikki Haley Tom Price and Betsy DeVos 
Soon: Americans share why they would be hurt by Tom Price's policies including #ACA repeal. I'll share VA stories: 
Memorial Bridge too compromised for #Inauguration &amp; #WomensMarch. We must fix this. Improving crumbling infrastructure has R and D support

Great time last night on the harmonica with the Cary Street Ramblers at @PositiveVibeRVA. A clip of Josie-o! 
My jam sesh with the Cary Street Ramblers tonight. Looking forward to playing the harp with them tomorrow at @PositiveVibeRVA 
I'm working on how we can improve the #ACA and health care. Great forum with @UVA medical school students today! 
Read my statement on my decision to support the nomination of Gen Mattis and oppose the nomination of Rex Tillerson 
The Sec State needs to put US interests above any other loyalty. Mr. Tillerson did not give me confidence in his ability to do that
Tillerson's answers on Russia and refusals to answer on ExxonMobil makes me question whether he could set aside the interests of ExxonMobil
Rex Tillerson however made many comments during his confirmation hearing that caused me concern
Gen Mattis appreciates challenges facing servicemembers &amp; is committed to strong civilian/military understanding. I support his confirmation
The US needs military and diplomatic leadership that understands our national security threats &amp; is fully committed to the US above all else
.@SECARMY Eric Fanning has been a superb Secretary of the @USArmy. I'm humbled to accept this civilian service award from him tonight

Last night Senate Rs moved us one step closer to health care chaos. We should be working to find fixes to the system not break it
Asked Tillerson about potential Trump financial conflicts of interest that could affect foreign policy. He's in the dark like the rest of us
It's shameful Tillerson refused to answer my questions on his company's role in funding phony climate science. Bottom line: #ExxonKnew
Inspiring message from President Obama. I'm thankful for his friendship steady leadership and the progress we've achieved #ObamaFarewell

Good advice @HillaryClinton. Factcheck: Donald Trump wrong on claim that he opposed Iraq War. 
Donald won't commit to support our election outcome won‚Äôt condemn Putin and won't defend American democracy. Yet he wants to be president.
Hey @realDonaldTrump. Here are Hillary and my taxes. Where are yours? 
The Clinton Foundation has an A+ rating from Charity Watch. Donald‚Äôs was prohibited from doing business in New York. What a fraud.
Donald has a pattern of demeaning groups of Americans. His comments on women weren‚Äôt the first. #DebateNight
Time and again Trump shows us he can't see women as equal. Watching Donald defend his behavior makes me sick to my stomach. #DebateNight
Hillary dedicated decades of her life to public service but with Trump it‚Äôs been decades of ‚Äúme-first.‚Äù

Trump basically admits that he's not paying federal taxes. Blue Star families like ours don't appreciate him stiffing our troops.
Donald might have gone nearly 20 years without paying taxes. That‚Äôs just un-American.

Donald Trump likes to talk trash but he only has good things to say about Putin.

@Hillary_esp: Desde hace 4 a√±os DACA ha ayudado a m√°s de 700 mil j√≥venes indocumentados a vivir sin miedo. Continuemos juntos. 
We've got some serious work ahead in addressing the problems in our criminal justice system:  
Hillary wrote an open letter to young people who are undocumented. Read it here: 
@HillaryClinton: The senseless murders of Imam Maulama Akonjee and Thara Uddin are heartbreaking. This kind of heinous act has no place‚Ä¶
A lot of strong women have helped me in my career. I'm honored to serve as a strong woman's running mate.

If you can dream a business you should be able to build it.  
We're facing a public health emergency and Republicans in Congress refuse to act. Americans deserve action on Zika. 
Just released my tax returns @realDonaldTrump. Where are yours? 
@CNN: Tim Kaine: How Hillary Clinton and I will make housing fair in America  
Your vote is important. If it weren't why would the other side be working so hard to stop you from voting? 
Housing discrimination cuts right to the heart of who we are as a society. We need to do all we can to fight it: 
@HillaryClinton: Congrats on bringing home the gold and silver Simone and Aly. We‚Äôre all so proud of you! -H 
When we vote we're doing something good for our country and spreading hope to people who need it around the world.

Under Trump's plan we'd lose nearly 3.5 million jobs in his first term. We can't afford a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired‚Äù president. 
Every time we interact with somebody we can come to know something about the greater good in the world. 
Donald Trump would make out like a bandit under his economic plan.Working families? Not so much. 
Indignante que el Congreso no haya actuado sobre Zika mientras familias enfrentan este problema de salud p√∫blica. Tenemos que actuar ahora.
Trump thinks giving another huge tax cut to those at the top will somehow help working families? Give me a break.
Congrats to the #FinalFive on their outstanding performance in Rio‚Äîand a special congrats to Virginia native @gabrielledoug!
Nobody who is seeking the presidency should do anything to countenance violence. That‚Äôs what Donald Trump did today: 
Trump's tax plan in a nutshell: cut rates for those at the top and leave working families to pick up the tab.
Politics has no place in the conversation around Zika funding. Families are hurting. It's time for Congress to act: 
Yes this Kansas-raised Mizzou-educated VP candidate will broker a deal to reinstate the Border War!  
David's letter to his daughter about why he can't support Donald Trump really hits home. 
The choice on jobs couldn't be clearer folks. 
I've been fortunate enough to meet some great businesspeople in my life‚Äîand none of them do business like Trump.

Donald Trump is only in it for himself‚Äîjust look at his economic plan.
We've got detailed policy plans but if it's about your own kid or business it's not a detail‚Äîit's a big deal.
Character is when you get knocked on your back trying something you care about and you don‚Äôt give up. 
The right to vote is at the heart of our democracy and a weakened VRA threatens that right for too many. It's time to #RestoreTheVRA.
Healing is about more than policy‚Äîit's people from all walks of life looking at things from others' points of view.

Shooting today in Baton Rouge is an absolute atrocity. All must condemn it
Horrified by the news in Baton Rouge this morning. No justification for these senseless acts of hateful violence.

@JeffFlake: Debate and passage of an #AUMF against #ISIL like the bipartisan proposal @timkaine &amp; I intro'd is long overdue 
Read my full statement on the President's address here: 
Congress needs to finally debate &amp; vote on an #AUMF. It shows our allies troops &amp; the public that we are unified in resolve against ISIL
The events of recent weeks demonstrate that Congress can no longer ignore ISIL threat and its constitutional duty to authorize war
House and Senate leaders should move consideration of an ISIL-specific #AUMF to the top of the legislative agenda
As @POTUS stated an #AUMF would demonstrate the American people are united and committed to the fight against ISIL
Happy #Hanukkah to everyone celebrating across Virginia and the nation!
