Thankful for America’s veterans and military families who sacrifice so much to protect the freedoms we hold so dear. Thinking of them this #VeteransDay. 
@SenateMajLdr Rather than distorting the facts about their plan Republicans should turn back &amp; work with Democrats on a bipartisan tax plan.
It’s now clear that the Senate tax plan would hammer middle-class families particularly in the suburbs violating @SenateMajLdr’s pledge that the GOP plan wouldn’t raise their taxes.

One thing is clear from the Senate GOP tax bill: the House compromise on the state &amp; local tax deduction was written in disappearing ink.
Still reading the details but based on what we’ve seen so far of the Senate GOP tax bill it’s clear that this is another tax giveaway to the rich &amp; big corps &amp; its coming squarely on the backs of those in the middle class.
Senate GOP has just released THEIR version of a tax bill - joining Senator @RonWyden to walk through just some of what's in it LIVE: 
@repjoecrowley: We need an honest title for the #GOPTaxScam bill. Let's call it what it is: H.R. 1%

Latino &amp; African American students are more likely to receive Pell Grants &amp; many take student loans. The GOP tax bill cuts these prgms that low- &amp; middle-income students depend on to attend college. Instead we need tax reform that helps the next generation follow their dreams.

@SenateDems: Tune in: @HouseDemocratsand @SenateDems are live unveiling a tax plan that *actually* helps the middle class: 
It’s becoming crystal clear: Republicans are on a fast track to fully eliminate the state &amp; local tax deduction. The compromise was never adequate but any Republican clinging to it as an excuse to vote for the tax bill should abandon ship before it’s too late. 
Congratulations to my friend @lhandsyr on 45 years of award winning reporting for @CNYcentral!
Still time to vote! Don't for a second think yours won't count. Find your polling place &amp; get there. #ElectionDay 
What starts as a modest tax cut for the average family of four making $59000/yr becomes a tax increase after only six years under GOP plan. 
The Child Tax Credits unlike the personal exemptions they replace lose value over time because they do NOT increase with inflation.
@nyulaw @davidckamin After 5 yrs the $300/person family credit is GONE!
As @nyulaw tax prof @davidckamin pointed out while some see initial tax cut that disappears after a few yrs &amp; taxes will start going up! 
By 2026 nearly half of all middle class families would pay more in taxes NEARLY HALF!!! 
@MarkWeinerDC: .@SenSchumer @NYGovCuomo on #GOPTaxPlan: It's a lump of coal for New York

I am confident that there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to get the #DreamAct passed before the end of the year.
GOP argues their plan gives the  middle class a tax break. What they wont tell you is many middle class families will see their taxes go up.
House GOP tax plan puts a burden that ought to be on the backs of the wealthy &amp; big corps &amp; drops it square on the back of the middle class.

When terrorism has struck us in the past presidents have brought us together. It’s a shame this president can’t. 
GOP also seemed poised to end the deductibility of state income &amp; sales taxes raising taxes on middle-class Americans from coast to coast.
If true GOP will hike taxes on middle-class Americans’ retirement savings all so they can line the pockets of the wealthy &amp; biggest corps.
Every American who is struggling to save for retirement should shudder at the latest reports on the GOP tax plan.

Again I’m calling on President Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to the vital anti-terrorism funding immediately.
The NYPD who bravely &amp; quickly brought the mayhem to an end yday depends on anti-terrorism funding to keep our city safe day-in &amp; day-out.
Calling on Pres Trump to rescind his proposed cuts to anti-terrorism funding immediately - our city relies on it to snuff out attacks.
President Trump should be focusing on the real solution – anti-terrorism funding – which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget.
Pres Trump instead of politicizing &amp; dividing America which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy should bring us together.
President Trump where is your leadership? The contrast btwn Pres Bush’s actions after 9-11 &amp; Pres Trump’s this am couldn't be starker.
President Bush in a moment of national tragedy understood the meaning of his high office &amp; sought to bring our country together.
And true to form -- something that made my heart swell with pride -- the New York City Halloween parade marched on last night.
NYers are resilient. We will bounce back. We won’t let terrorists get their way or affect our way of life—we will never let terror prevail.
These attacks are meant to confuse and terrorize. But as the world learned after 9-11 and will learn again: New York doesn’t scare easy.
I rode on that path just this past wkend. My daughter went to the school near the scene &amp; used the bike path. It's our territory. Our home.
As one of the thousands of NYers who regularly ride on the path where this attack took place it hits close to home.
We are also grateful – deeply grateful – to the NYPD &amp; 1st responders especially Officer Ryan Nash who was the first on the scene.
Our hearts go out to the victims and their families and we wish all the injured a full and speedy recovery.
Yday a man deliberately drove a truck into groups of pedestrians &amp; cyclists killing 8 &amp; injuring over a dozen. Some were schoolchildren.
I rise this morning with a heavy heart. A city no stranger to terrorism was once again its victim last night – my home city of New York.
I’m calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding. 3/3
which he always seems to do at times of natl tragedy should focus on anti-terrorism funding which he proposed cutting in his budget. 2/3
Always believed &amp; cont. to believe that immigration is good for America. Pres Trump instead of politicizing &amp; dividing America 1/3
I guess it's not too soon to politicize a tragedy.
My full statement in response to President Trump’s proposed funding cuts to anti-terrorism efforts: 
Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried &amp; saddened to hear about injuries &amp; loss of life.
If Americans needed more proof #TrumpTax plan would be a boon for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class look no further than this: 
@RobertHarding: Come for the story about steel imports stay for the photo of @SenSchumer holding rebar

The facts are the facts. Special Counsel Mueller's investigation has revealed there was a connection btwn the Trump campaign &amp; Russia.
@SenateDems Democrats want to make it easier to save for retirement. Republicans want to make it harder by increasing taxes on middle class Americans.

Today @NYGovCuomo &amp; I were in the Capital Region where &gt;29% of locals use the state &amp; local tax deduction w/ an avg deduction of $12916.

Congrats to @CDTA - 2017 Mid Sized Transit System of the Year! They're doing great things in the Capital District &amp; it's only the beginning.

@voxdotcom: Trump’s executive order to undermine Obamacare explained 
@ACSCAN: Exec Order could leave millions of cancer patients unable to get coverage &amp; others could get inadequate benefits. 
@POTUS And it will add further chaos to the markets.  If the system deteriorates make no mistake about it the blame will fall squarely on @POTUS.
".@POTUS' exec order couldn't be further from his ""great health care"" promise. It will up costs for seniors &amp; ppl w/ preexisting conditions."
@POTUS This executive order is just the latest in a series of steps he has taken to sabotage health care at the expense of millions of Americans.
Having failed to repeal the #ACA in Congress @POTUS is using a wrecking ball to singlehandedly rip apart &amp; sabotage our healthcare system.
@SenSchumer: There is still devastation Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done. 
There is still devastation Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done. 
@realDonaldTrump Why do you continue to treat Puerto Ricans differently than other Americans when it comes to natural disasters?
@realDonaldTrump FEMA needs to stay until the job is done and right now it's not even close to done.

US workers deserve an open transparent NAFTA negotiation not a backroom deal.  if you want USTR to hold NAFTA town halls. #ABetterDeal
.@SenateDems have proposed #ABetterDeal on Trade &amp; Jobs calling for TEN NAFTA town halls across America. 
When it comes to NAFTA Trump Admin should carefully listen to the public &amp; stakeholders to negotiate the best outcome for American workers.
What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors &amp; fams @SafeHorizon @sffny &amp; @cvtcnyc.

Economists think tanks even his former employer @GoldmanSachs dispute Sec Steve Mnuchin's #TrumpTax plan claims. 
Sec. Mnuchin &amp; Adviser Cohn know from their work at @GoldmanSachs their tax plan won’t pay for itself: 
Unlike the Trump Administration Sec. Mnuchin &amp; Gary Cohn’s former employer @GoldmanSachs says the #TrumpTax plan would cost &gt;$2.5 Trillion.
Los estados las empresas y expertos en salud apoyan El Plan de Energía Limpia  para reducir emisiones de GEI y proteger la salud pública.
States biz electric utilities &amp; health professionals support #CleanPowerPlan cause they support protecting our kids' health. #ProtectCPP 
As much as he'll deny it @EPAScottPruitt wants to pick winners &amp; losers. We all lose unless we #ProtectCPP. 
Frankly rigging the system for polluters won't help kids w/ asthma farms or recreation biz or Americans looking for jobs in this economy.
At a time when our weather is so volatile we must do more to fight climate change &amp; protect our communities not less. #ProtectCPP
Alejarnos de El Plan de Energía Limpia tendría consecuencias reales - para nuestro ambiente nuestra salud y nuestra economía.
Walking away from the #CleanPowerPlan would have real costs – to our environment our health &amp; our economy.
W/ America seeing more extreme &amp; dangerous weather than ever before last thing we should do is roll back actions to combat #ClimateChange.
Thanks to the first responders fire fighters &amp; law enforcement working around the clock to save lives &amp; get more people out of danger.

@PostOpinions: The Trump administration’s tax plan is an atrocity  by @LHSummers
The @EPA must live up to its mission and continue cleaning up radioactive waste in Niagara County. The residents deserve better. 
If the President was serious about protecting the #Dreamers his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so.
.@NancyPelosi &amp; I told @POTUS we were open to reasonable border security alongside #DreamAct -his list goes so far beyond whats reasonable.
The Admin can't be serious about compromise w/ a list anathema to #Dreamers to the immigrant community &amp; to the vast majority of Americans.

@civilrightsorg: Here's our statement on the Trump administration's roll back of the ACA's contraception mandate: 
This decision is just the latest in a series of moves the Trump Admin has made to sabotage our health care system. It can't continue. 
Weve long turned the page on days when a boss could stand btwn a woman &amp; her healthcare decisions – @POTUS' decision drags the US backwards.
This outrageous decision rips a fundamental right away from millions of hard working women. 
The GOP's partisan plan to repeal this deduction must be scrapped. They should start over w #TaxReform that truly benefits the middle class.
It's crystal clear the benefits of this deduction touch every state every big city every small town &amp; municipality across the country.

44 million Americans all across the country take the state &amp; local tax deduction (~1/3 of all taxpayers) &amp; they get $1Ks off their taxes.
GOP tax plan actually raises taxes on millions of middle-class families by repealing the state and local tax deduction a real Trump Tax.
These #Dreamers love this country just like I do. And you know what's truly American? Helping them. Let's pass the #DreamActNow!

I say to @POTUS come out &amp; support a law to ban bump stocks the modification used by the Las Vegas gunman to make his weapons automatic.
@NancyPelosi: Republicans need to stop misleading Americans and tell the truth: their tax plan will raise taxes on middle class families…
It’s imperative that Congress quickly pass additional aid to help Puerto Rico USVI &amp; other states hit by storms and wildfires.
This is a good start but those affected by Maria Harvey Irma &amp; wildfires still have a long &amp; difficult road ahead.

@thinkprogress: Republican budget would decimate Medicare and Medicaid  
ICYMI @washingtonpost doled out 4 pinnochios for some pretty extraordinary claims about the GOP Tax plan:  
@CenterOnBudget: The Senate GOP's $1.5 trillion tax cuts will have to be paid for. The vast majority of Americans will likely lose: 
Today @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats wrote @POTUS urging him to reject GOP budget that cuts Medicare &amp; more. 
Starting soon: @SenateDems highlight how the GOP plan favors the rich and sticks it to the middle class. 
It can be a little hard to find but it's right there in the GOP budget: $473 billion from #Medicare over a trillion from #Medicaid. 
The #Yankees Win!
Met w/ Puerto Rican &amp; USVI ldrs today on hurricane relief efforts underway &amp; what's still to be done. Congress must act to provide relief. 
@POTUS To have the gall to complain about PR while proposing tax cuts for millionaires that will cost trillions is the height of hypocrisy.
@POTUS Yes we’re spending money in Puerto Rico. To turn the power back on. To give ppl drinking water. And to keep life support machines working.
I don’t remember @POTUS telling Texas that they’d thrown our budget out of whack after Harvey. Or Florida after Irma.
Look I'm glad @POTUS is going to Las Vegas tomorrow that's a good idea. But he's got more to do. 
Meet Denisse DACA recipient &amp; NY med student testifying today @ Judiciary Cmmte Hearing. This is her home #DreamAct 
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump it's time to stand up to the @NRA &amp; stand up for the over 30000 Americans who are victims of #gunviolence each YEAR. 4/4
@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump come out against the GOP's absurd silencers law. Say youll veto it. Bring Congress tgtr &amp; address #gunviolence head-on. 3/
@POTUS After #LasVegas @POTUS should remember he ran as an outsider who wasn't beholden to special interests. It's time to buck the NRA. 2/
We cannot banish evil or madness frm the earth. But Congress &amp; @POTUS must do all in our power to make our country a safer place to live. 1/
The first duty of good government: to keep one’s people safe. I'll speak more on that LIVE in a few minutes. Watch: 
Tune in NOW for an important hearing on the #DREAMAct &amp; what the future holds for #DACA recipients: 
@SenFranken: @FCC @AjitPaiFCC Let me be very clear: getting rid of #netneutrality would destroy the internet as we know it.
Still time to make your voices heard. Senate vote on #NetNeutrality opponent @AjitPai’s nomination to the @FCC hasn't started yet.
Very soon the Senate is scheduled to vote on @FCC Chair Ajit Pai’s nom for another 5yr term. Tune in if you're worried about #netneutrality
What Congress can &amp; must do is pass laws that keep our citizens safe starting w/ laws to help prevent guns frm falling into the wrong hands
But we cannot banish evil from the earth. Congress can’t do that. Presidents can’t do that.
We will take care of the injured. We will mourn those lost with all our collective love &amp; support. We will bind up this new national wound.
We will have to reckon with the fact that this man was able to assemble an arsenal of military-grade weapons.
Some of the questions we have today won’t have clear answers; others are perhaps beyond our fathoming. But some will have answers.
What led a man to commit such violence upon his fellow human beings complete strangers? What twisted reasoning? What madness?
What was this person’s perverted motive? Was there any history of mental health issues?
How did this monster acquire the arsenal he used to rain down death on a crowd of innocents?  Were those guns purchased &amp; compiled legally?
Today we are filled with shock and horror sadness and rage. And we are left with more questions than answers.
ICYMI - I spoke this afternoon about the Las Vegas shooting now the deadliest mass shooting in US history. 
I commend the Las Vegas 1st responders the SWAT team &amp; the regular ppl who acted quickly &amp; saved lives. Thank you.
Deeply saddened for the people of Las Vegas and the country. We will keep the victims &amp; their families in our hearts.
GOP #TaxReform plan &amp; what @SpeakerRyan says about it are 2 diff things. Says plan is for middle class but 80% is for wealthy-Get real Paul.
@FaceTheNation: Schumer on tax reform says GOP plan completely focused on wealthy &amp; powerful blows huge hole in deficit &amp; not bipartisan
@FaceTheNation: .@SenSchumer criticizes the proposed #taxreform framework and says it will not help the middle class: 
@FaceTheNation: .@SenSchumer message to Trump: Quit the Twitter  roll up your sleeves and get to work on Puerto Rico 
@FaceTheNation: This morning: @SenSchumer joins the broadcast to discuss the crisis in Puerto Rico and more.  Be sure to tune in.
@nytpolitics: Half of the benefit of the Republican tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners a new study finds. 
@Wonkblog: GOP tax plan would provide major gains for richest 1 percent and uneven benefits for the middle class report says 
".@TaxPolicyCenter says under GOP #TaxReform ""&gt;1/4 middle-income families would pay more in taxes."" "
My friend @NancyPelosi and I are ready to fight harder than ever to pass the #DreamAct. 
"Under GOP #TaxReform plan ""80 percent of the tax benefits would accrue to those in the top 1 percent."" "
America must be a leader for freedom and democracy and safety for refugees is part of that. 
@PodSaveAmerica: New Pod is up! Healthcare's future Roy Moore &amp; tax reform. Guests @SenSchumer &amp; @anamariecox 
@HHSGov We must get patients out of #PuertoRico and to the care they need. @HHSGov can and must do more.
@HHSGov People are dying and some patients need to be evacuated. #PuertoRico
@HHSGov Dialysis centers are relying on generators. Those centers need clean water &amp; diesel. #PuertoRico
.@HHSGov the situation is not under control. People are not receiving care they need. They need resources #PuertoRico.
My office has been talking to Dialysis companies American Kidney Fund &amp; HHS about emergency situation in #PuertoRico with Dialysis patients
As we were saying...
So proud of the NYers rallying to help #PuertoRico. Learn more about how to get involved w/ orgs like @HispanicFed 
The fed gov must do more to help those whose lives were upended by #Maria. If youre looking for ways to do the same: 
@usairforce Our military is upping resources to PR but we need more personnel trucks helicopters to direct &amp; transport supplies et al on the ground.
Yesterday I met with @usairforce General Lori Robinson who is in charge of the military’s role in the relief efforts for #PuertoRico. 
We cannot forget the utter devastation facing 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
.@POTUS said his tax plan would create a middle class miracle. I think it would be a miracle if it helped the middle class.
And what kind of #TaxReform plan removes the State &amp; Local deduction when that's what keeps middle class families from being taxed twice?
"How does GOP #TaxReform ""help farmers"" by repealing the #EstateTax when only 50 small farms or biz would pay that this year?"
When you cut taxes on the top 1% &amp; raise them for the lowest income Americans that's NOT pro-American. #wealthfare
The GOP #TaxReform plan is even worse than their healthcare plan. Instead of #wealthcare it's #wealthfare. 
@FCC We can’t entrust them with the Internet – they’re already working on gutting #NetNeutrality
@FCC Chairman Pai &amp; the GOP already handed over your private data to big ISPs to sell to the highest bidder.
We need an @FCC chair who believes in free &amp; #OpenInternet &amp; knows it is a tool for science art entrepreneurs -not just corporate profits.
@SenateMajLdr @FCC Chairman Pai has bucked the calls of everyday Americans for #NetNeutrality prioritizing the demands of big cable &amp; ISPs.
Tomorrow @SenateMajLdr will have the Senate vote for another 5 yr term for @FCC Chair Ajit Pai. I will vote w/ a resounding NO.
The state deduction helps the middle class avoid double taxation - something I thought the GOP opposed. 
We urge the GOP to pursue mainstream #taxreform that has fiscally responsible tax cuts for Americans who need it not donors who demand it.
Rs &amp; Ds used to agree on the Baker Rule: #taxreform must be revenue neutral judged on its own merits. No dynamic scoring. No Fake Math.
If they don’t pay for it they’ll balloon the deficit and debt and then try to slash #Medicare and other important programs instead.
On top of that this would cost anywhere from 5 to 7 TRILLION dollars and they have no credible plan to pay for it.
So if you are a giant corporation or in the top 1% - the GOP has a #TaxReform plan for you. If you aren’t?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Plain &amp; simple: GOP #TaxReform ⬇️ the tax rate on the wealthiest from 39.6% to 35%. But ⬆️ for those working to make it to the middle class.
In #TaxReform @POTUS asks Rs Ds &amp; Is to come together for a pro-America tax code. One problem. Their plan is pro-the top 1% of-Americans
Here’s the GOP #TaxReform plan. Their cover page could be the nicest part: 
Sitting here still trying to figure out how this #TaxReform plan helps the middle class like teachers policemen nurses &amp; more. 
A lot to unpack with the GOP's #TaxReform plan. Joining Sen @RonWyden LIVE now: 
.@SenBobCorker is a friend fine conscientious &amp;hard-working. His thoughtfulness &amp; dedication make him a model Sen. We regret him leaving.
Laid these steps out over a wk ago. Equifax should provide consumers w/every opportunity to try &amp; protect themselves. They've fallen short. 
A change in leadership is exactly what we called for. But much much more needs to be done at @Equifax. 
Las palabras se las lleva el viento. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses en Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes necesitan acción y resultados.

@SenateFinance Tune in  at 2pm for the first &amp; only hearing the GOP has agreed to on their latest #Trumpcare bill. #ProtectOurCare
There is a @SenateFinance hearing TODAY at 2pm on latest #Trumpcare bill. But what about the debate? The markup? Amendments? Regular order?
@SenateDems: Join @SenGillibrand &amp; @PattyMurray with @MomsRising and @PPFA now on #Trumpcare: 
"""...no room for delay or debate about rushing federal help to the citizens &amp; govt of Puerto Rico &amp; the stricken communities of the USVI."" "
Rs must join Ds &amp; work in a bipartisan way to provide relief for Puerto Rico &amp; the USVI as they find a new normal after Irma &amp; Maria.
Fighting to repeal health care while millions of Americans in #PuertoRico are struggling to find shelter is unconscionable.
It could take 6 months to restore power to 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. #Trumpcare is not more pressing.
The skies may be clearer over Puerto Rico but there are still dark days ahead for Americans struggling to connect w/ family &amp; move forward.
Joined US veterans today who risked their lives for this nation &amp; shouldn’t have to fight to save their benefits from cuts under #Trumpcare

@jimmykimmel If you stand w/ @hospitals4kids @AARPadvocates @LittleLobbyists @AmerMedicalAssn &amp; others fighting to #ProtectOurCare you know what to do.
@jimmykimmel If you think more Americans should have access to maternal care &amp; contraception - not less - make your voices heard. 
If you think #Trumpcare should pass the @jimmykimmel test make your voices heard. 
If you think more American children veterans seniors and families should be covered - not less - make your voices heard.
If you think Americans should keep guaranteed coverage for maternity care substance abuse &amp; prescription drugs make your voice heard.
If you think Americans w/ pre-existing conditions should focus on getting healthy instead of fighting discrimination make your voice heard.
I don't understand why some of my colleagues support the Cassisdy-Graham bill but I do know they need to hear from you. #ProtectOurCare
New #Trumpcare would cause millions to lose coverage eliminates protections for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; ups out-of-pocket costs.

#Trumpcare lives again under the name Graham-Cassidy. It's another bill that drastically cuts health funding for Americans who need it most.

@MarchofDimes: We stand with 15 patient &amp; provider groups to oppose Graham-Cassidy bill. We urge Senators to vote NO. 
Make your voices heard New York. This latest #Trumpcare bill is meaner than ever. 
Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill Cassidy-Graham Iowa would lose $525 Million in federal funding. #ProtectOurCare
Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill Cassidy-Graham Arkansas would lose $1.1Billion in federal funding.
Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill Cassidy-Graham Colorado would lose $823 Million in federal funding. #ProtectOurCare

@SenateDems On top of that we want to give #ABetterDeal to the talented men &amp; women caring for our children &amp; increase their pay. They deserve it.
@SenateDems Dems also want to double the number of children who are eligible for child care assistance.
.@SenateDems' #ABetterDeal ensures no family under 150% of state median income pays more than 7% of their income on child care.

Tax season is months away but teachers need to know about the Educator Expense Deduction! Visit: 
New York teachers: don’t miss out on this important tax deduction #Back2School 
I fought for the deduction but not enough of our teachers know about it – an estimated 103000 upstate NY teachers missed out on it in 2015
With the Teacher Expense Deduction out-of-pocket expenses for books supplies and computer equipment could earn teachers a tax deduction.
In NY @UFT says our great teachers spend an average of $485 of their own money on classroom supplies. They deserve a tax break!

@KrisKobach1787 @Heritage When asked by a reporter commission mbr @HvonSpakovsky who works for @Heritage denied any knowledge of the email: 
@KrisKobach1787 Also an email surfaced yesterday from @Heritage to the Administration demanding the #ShamVotingCommission exclude Dems &amp; mainstream Reps 
For starters @KrisKobach1787 doubled down on lies about fraud in NH elections which were struck down by the NH SOS.

Once Kirssy was terrified to talk about her status. DACA changed her life &amp; let us hear her story.  #ProtectDREAMers
A few yrs ago I spoke at #DREAMer Kirssy Martinez’s graduation from @BCCcuny where she was the co-valedictorian with a perfect 4.0 GPA.
It's clear the decision to end DACA is bad economics. But the moral cost is devastating. #ProtectDREAMers
We've heard from hundreds of business leaders many who signed onto this letter in defense of DACA. #DREAMers 
Ending DACA would deprive thousands of employers who rely on these workers &amp; would cost them nearly $2 billion over two years alone.
The 800K DREAMers in the US work in our companies go to our schools &amp; serve in our military. Ending DACA throws their future into doubt.
@SenateDems: Hear from @SenSchumer on the latest agreement &amp; what's next in the Senate: 
@SenatorDurbin: Tune in to watch my Senate colleagues on the floor calling for passage of the #DreamAct: 
And there's still a lot more work to do: #DREAMAct Children's Health Insurance Prgm Flood Insurance FAA and national defense bill.
The nation can breathe a sigh of relief. We've agreed to help those recovering from Hurricane Harvey avoid default &amp; avoid a shutdown.
Congress has an ability &amp; obligation to #ProtectDREAMers - urging @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr to immediately put the #DreamAct to a vote.
In fact a recent @amprog study found 91% of DACA recipients are employed paying taxes and paying into Social Security.
Make no mistake: #DREAMers contribute greatly to our country especially to our businesses &amp; our economy as a whole. #ProtectDREAMers
.@POTUS' decision to end DACA was heartless &amp; it was brainless. If it stands families will be ripped apart &amp; biz will lose employees.
Starting soon! Tune in:

Well said my friend @SenJohnMcCain. Let's get to work. 
We haven't heard back from President @realDonaldTrump or @SenateMajLdr McConnell on our #ABetterDeal plan.What say you?
#ABetterDeal will create 15M new infrastructure jobs lower Rx drug costs &amp; finally crackdown on bad trade deals. 
America's working families deserve #ABetterDeal - more jobs higher pay &amp; lower expenses. Democrats have a plan to do just that.
Today's jobs report showing slower job growth and stagnant wages is disappointing.
Who doesn’t love Maury? EVERYONE loves Maury. Have a great retirement you’ve definitely earned it. 
Trump Admin is deliberately sabotaging our healthcare system. When number of insured drops &amp; costs rise American ppl will know who to blame

Looking fwd to sitting down w/ Delaware County leaders today for an economic dev't roundtable to talk about growing &amp; creating local biz.
Exactly right. We hope for the sake of the country @POTUS will decide to work with us and put the middle class first. 
Ending #DACA would crush the dreams of a generation of immigrants. We can't sit idly by and let this happen. #DefendDACA
Diana &amp; nearly 800000 immigrant youth like her are the embodiment of our American values but their futures and that of DACA is uncertain.
DACA has allowed Diana to go back to school find a steady job and focus on her grades. She says DACA has given her life consistency.
NY Dreamer Diana was 12 years old when she found out she was undocumented and was told to never say it out loud.

Great and good American presidents seek to unite not divide. Donald Trump’s remarks clearly show he is not one of them.

Because of today's abhorrent rally a young woman is dead &amp; many more ppl are injured or in critical condition. They are all in our prayers.
Of course we condemn ALL that hate stands for. Until @POTUS specifically condemns alt-right action in Charlottesville he hasnt done his job
March &amp; rally in Charlottesville against everything the flag stands for. President Trump must condemn in strongest terms immediately.

We need a new NAFTA one that supports American jobs &amp; higher wages. When it comes to trade Americans deserve #ABetterDeal
We need to revamp our trade laws from top to bottom &amp; provide #ABetterDeal for the American worker. Here's how: 
Remember #ABetterDeal has three goals:-Raise wages &amp; create jobs-Lower expenses-Build a 21st Century economyToday we're talking trade.

Glad @SenAlexander &amp; @PattyMurray will work to stabilize insurance markets long term but @POTUS must make CSR payments this mo so they can.
The American ppl need a modern tax system. We’re ready to work w/ GOP to achieve that. See our principles here: 
And yet wages and incomes haven't come close to keeping pace. What about the American worker @realDonaldTrump? 
In 2017 Black women still need to work 20 months to make as much as white non-Hispanic men did in 12. That's not #BlackWomensEqualPay

If @POTUS refuses to make CSR payments every expert agrees that premiums will go up &amp; #healthcare will be more expensive for millions.
I agree with @SenatorCardin. The current policy isn't working. @POTUS needs to sign the sanctions bill to increase pressure on DPRK &amp; China. 
@LittleLobbyists: Thank you @SenSchumer ! We are also relieved that we can keep our health care. 
Thank you. This fight is for you. 
No estamos celebrando estamos aliviados de que millones de personas estadounidenses amanecieron hoy con la garantiza de seguro médico.
Gracias a todos por sus llamadas por sus esfuerzos y por hacer escuchar sus voces. Este proyecto de ley fue derrotada gracias a ustedes.
But health care is not the only issue that needs bipartisanship. Taxes infrastructure and more are on the horizon. We must come together.
This is how the Senate works. This is 'regular order.' We can work together. We will. Democrats are ready to sit down &amp; improve our system.
We should sit down and trade ideas with our Republican colleagues.
We can stabilize the markets through funding cost sharing reduction &amp; creating reinsurance programs which keeps premiums deductibles down.
Now it's time for the Senate to come together in a bipartisan way to fix the problems that exist in our healthcare system.
But we are not celebrating. We are relieved--for the millions of Americans who can keep their insurance and breathe a little easier.
To everyone who called tweeted emailed and raised their voice in any way: thank you. Your stories matter. They matter a great deal.
To my Democratic colleagues: your determination to protect health care was a sight to see. I'm so proud of our work.
An update on last night. First: I want to thank Sens. Murkowski Collins and McCain for showing such courage strength and principle.
@SenateDems: Starting at about 11:15am ET: an update on where we go from here from @SenSchumer. Tune in:  
We are not celebrating; we are relieved--for the Americans who can now keep their #healthcare. We must work together to improve the law.
You're going to want to watch this:  #ResistRepeal

...other military members or will force them to hide who they are &amp; obtain medical care outside the military system (as they did before).
The issue is whether we will allow them to serve on the same terms as everyone else and receive medical care in the same manner as...
We already have transgender people serving in our military - and we will regardless what the president says or does.
@SenGillibrand: ...only to be told (on Twitter no less) that their Commander in Chief doesn't want them in any capacity—it's outrageous!
@SenGillibrand: This morning transgender service members put on uniform and showed up to their military duties...
Democrats are NOT going to continue trying to amend current bill when there is a secret bill waiting to emerge from @SenateMajLdr's office.
Nonpartisan @USCBO says under GOP plan 16 mil Americans would lose their health insurance &amp; millions more would pay 20% more for premiums.
"If the reporting is accurate &amp; the GOP plans on ""#SkinnyRepeal"" it actually makes premiums HIGHER than they are today."
@USCBO Docs widely oppose GOP plan say ACA model “is the foundation of improving access to care &amp; vital to ensuring everyone has health coverage.”
And @USCBO says GOP plan: “would cause a substantial reduction in the # of ppl with health insurance.” 15 million less Americans insured.
Turns out their plan is just another attempt to sabotage #healthcare &amp; would mean 20% higher premiums for American families.
GOP seems to be pushing a “skinny” repeal bill so it can pass the House but it turns out the effects of skinny repeal won’t be so skinny.
Today we’ll vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. #RepealandRun will fail.
Transgender Americans are serving honorably in our military.  We stand with these patriots.
We're not giving up on #healthcare. Join us on the steps of the Capitol or watch online &amp; share here: 
That’s the only thing that the House Freedom Caucus will accept and we all know the House Freedom Caucus is running the House GOP.
A 'yes' vote on the motion to proceed will lead to a conference with the House which will certainly lead to a vote on full repeal.
I urge each and every senator to remember that when casting their vote later this afternoon.
It will be a permission slip to slash Medicaid and healthcare programs with abandon in order to provide a massive windfall for the wealthy.
Make no mistake: a ‘yes’ vote on the motion to proceed is a vote on a path toward full repeal of #healthcare.
Looking fwd to joining @NCILAdvocacy advocates from NY &amp; US &amp; all joining online. We're LIVE here:  #ADAPTandRESIST

Keeping out-of-pocket costs low? Think again when it comes to the @SenateGOP #healthcare bill. It INCREASES your deductible. 
@news4buffalo: A State of Emergency has been issued for Town of Hamburg following today's weather event.
.@SenateDems remain eager to work w/ the GOP to lower premiums stabilize the market &amp; improve coverage for millions of Americans.
This plan is a slippery way to cut off millions of Americans’ access to #healthcare including Medicaid &amp; destroy the marketplaces.
The GOP #healthcare plan would jack up out-of-pocket costs for middle class families under the guise of lower premiums &amp; deficit reduction.
No amount of tweaks modifications or giveaways the Senate GOP makes can change the fact that their bill is rotten to its core.
6 month anniversary of #Carrier announcement ⟶ over 300 Carrier workers laid off &amp; more to come. That’s another #BrokenPromise from @POTUS
"Two words to @SenateGOP when @realDonaldTrump says “I'll have your back"" when you vote to repeal health care: Jeff Sessions."
.@SenJohnMcCain you are a true fighter &amp; I'll be praying for you until you beat this. I know you will.
@POTUS Time for GOP to work w/ Democrats to pass real solutions to lower premiums stabilize the market &amp; improve coverage for mils of Americans.
.@POTUS &amp; the GOP have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite. 
Good @WhiteHouse made this commitment but until payments are permanent markets wont be as stable as they could be

Glad to hear @POTUS invited NY's @libertytabletop -the last #MadeinUSA flatware manufacturer- to the WH for #MadeInAmericaWeek...
The GOP plan to #RepealandDelay hasnt gotten better w/ age. It leaves more uninsured &amp; increases premiums for hardworking American families. 
Last night we learned the current GOP #healthcare bill won't come to the Senate Floor. Speaking soon about what's next. Tune in on @facebook
This second failure of #Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable. #ProtectOurCare
Thanks @LittleLobbyists for all your hard work today talking about the #healthcarebill on Capitol Hill! #ProtectOurCare #AmericaSpeaksOut 
.@urbaninstitute says New York's uninsured rate would be 96.9% higher under the @SenateGOP healthcare bill. #ProtectOurCare 
It makes no sense that the GOP would consider a bill that would allow insurers to sell policies that don't cover #preexistingconditions.
The Cruz amdt by allowing insurers to sell junk insurance would actually increase out-of-pocket costs on average Americans #ProtectOurCare
GOP bill would touch the lives of every American but they've held no hearings w/ experts in a public setting.

Well we've now seen the revised Republican #Trumpcare bill. Little has changed. 
@SenateDems: Leader @SenSchumer on the latest version of the #Trumpcare bill - watch LIVE: 
.@washingtonpost has it right. The GOP's tax cuts for the rich mean healthcare cuts for women &amp; low-income Americans 
GOP plan to cut #Medicaid reimbursements to @PPFA hits NY rural communities hard. @SenateGOP where will these NYers go for quality care?

Simply put: It’s time to throw open the closed doors &amp; work on a bipartisan solution that ensures quality affordable health care.
If the GOP's plan was to cause premium increases for millions of American families they have succeeded.
From day 1 the Trump Administration’s actions on #healthcare have brought great uncertainty to the insurance markets;
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr We’ve even asked to vote on legislation to stabilize markets &amp; help American ppl. @SenateGOP won't give bills the time of day.
We can’t even count the # of times @SenateDems have asked @SenateMajLdr to drop this repeal plan &amp; work w/ us to improve #healthcare
On top of that this #healthcare amendment totally destabilizes the health insurance marketplaces.
Remember: the Cruz Lee #healthcare amdt would jack up premiums &amp; make health care less affordable &amp; accessible for millions of Americans
Praying for our selfless servicemen &amp; women &amp; their families today after we lost 16 brave souls in Mississippi. May they Rest In Peace.
Time to come together on #healthcare. It IS possible. 
Praying for the victims of Sunday night's shooting in Jefferson Co NYS Trooper Joel Davis killed in the line of duty &amp; Nichole Walters.
My heart goes out to the families of Sunday night's shooting in Jefferson Co esp NYS Trooper Joel Davis who was killed in the line of duty.
It’s time to move on from the failing GOP-only approach &amp; start over in a bipartisan way on healthcare. Offered these ideas today: 
"A ""Cruz insurance policy"" is worse than none at all because vast majority of ppl would pay a monthly premium &amp; never hit their deductible."
The Cruz amdt the latest addition to the #healthcare bill would actually make health care more expensive upping out-of-pocket expenses.
Train delayed? Tweet @POTUS to support rail infrastructure programs like #Gateway so we have tunnels &amp; rail systems that work for you.

Other low points: @POTUS agreeing w/ Putin to form a so called working group on cyber security; laughing tghr &amp; mocking the free press.
Instead of decisively confronting Putin head on @POTUS seemed to acquiesce to his denial opening the door for future Russian interference.
@POTUS As our Intel Community has unanimously concluded Putin deliberately interfered in our elections &amp; sought to destabilize our democracy.
Clearly the lowest moment of all was @POTUS' meeting with Vladimir Putin on several counts.
While a few good things came out of the G20 summit overall it was an embarrassment to our country &amp; our ideals.
This will not fool the millions of people who will be harmed by #Trumpcare 
"""...with figures and analyses from conservative groups and Republicans that show more benefits and less disruption should the bill pass"""
"""...which shows that 22 million fewer people would have insurance coverage by 2026 than under the current law —"""
"""When Trump returns from Europe he plans to counter the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the legislation..."
When every other non-partisan org says your plan is bad you can either change the plan or make up fake numbers. #Trumpcare 
Albany Fire Dept does not currently have a training center of its own but w/ @DHSgov sign off they'll get the the tools &amp; equipmt they need. 
@POTUS Giving equal credence to the US Intel Community's findings &amp; Putin's assertion is a grave dereliction of duty &amp; will only encourage Russia.
.@POTUS had an obligation to bring up Russia’s interference in our election &amp; to take the word of our Intel Community rather than Putin's.
Working to compromise the integrity of our elections cannot &amp; should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion.
Only way to truly improve #healthcare is for the Trump admin to stop sabotaging marketplaces &amp; for GOP to finally work in a bipartisan way.
@SenTedCruz If GOP is foolish enough to pass this those w/ #preexistingconditions will almost certainly be left w/out access to affordable quality care
Under @SenTedCruz amdt deductibles &amp; copays would be so onerous many Americans would pay much more out of their pockets than they pay today.
Make no mistake the @SenTedCruz amendment is a hoax. Under the guise of lowering premiums it makes health care more expensive.
@POTUS Putin and his oligarch's corruption and fleecing of Russia and its people.

@POTUS Putin's support to Russian-led separatists in the Donbas &amp; failure to comply w Minsk Agreemts. We stand w/ our Ukrainian brothers &amp; sisters.
@POTUS Putin's occupation and annexation of Crimea.
@POTUS Putin's interference in the elections of our European allies &amp; partners. We stand with our friends in Europe.
@POTUS Putin's interference in our elections last yr. Attack on our democracy. House needs to pass Senate sanctions bill. 
It's baffling that @POTUS doesn't have a specific agenda for the Putin meeting. Here are the first few things that come to my mind:

Today we march. Join us outside the Capitol or LIVE here:  #ProtectOurCare #Trumpcare
We need real solutions in this opioid crisis. Not CUTS to programs like #Medicaid that help the most.
In Rochester &amp; the Finger Lakes region in 2015 there were 119 opioid-related deaths an increase of 110 people from 2004.
In Central New York in 2015 there were 158 opioid-related deaths an increase of 156 people from 2004.
In the Capital Region in 2015 there were 106 opioid-related deaths an increase of 96 people from 2004.
In the North Country in 2015 there were 59 opioid-related deaths an increase of 56 people from 2004.
In Hudson Valley in 2015 there were 295 opioid-related deaths an increase of 279 people from 2004.
In the Southern Tier in 2015 there were 90 opioid-related deaths an increase of 88 people from 2004.
In Western New York in 2015 there were 308 opioid-related deaths an increase of 292 from 2004.
In NY we need #Medicaid to help fight this crisis more than ever. Across upstate NY from 2004 -2015 opioid deaths have gone up:
The current Senate #healthcare bill will eviscerate #Medicaid - the largest payer of substance use disorder services in the nation.
"Couldn't agree more: ""Removing vital coverage for those most in need is not the answer to our nation's health care problems"" "
I have a challenge for @POTUS. It's simple: let's move forward on #healthcare in an open bipartisan way. 
Under BCRA the number of non elderly uninsured New Yorkers would go up from 7.9% to 15.7% ⏩that's 99% increase in the uninsured! #Trumpcare 
I met Melba &amp; her mom last fall &amp; I'm still fighting for them telling their story &amp; urging my colleagues to think of them when they vote.

The healthcare fight is far from over. Hear more LIVE:

My colleagues &amp; I have been fighting for months for Americans like Melba. We won't stop any time soon.
That wasn't by the grace of god. It was because of #Medicaid. Period.
During Superstorm Sandy when the power went out Melba's aid walked into Manhattan to be w/ her when she couldn't leave her 8th fl apt.
For Melba daily activities are possible thanks to #Medicaid. She has a health aid who helps w/ meals getting to work even getting dressed.
This is my constituent Melba &amp; she has lived on the Lower East Side her whole life. She's in a wheelchair &amp; has cerebral palsy.

The Senate GOP's healthcare bill was supposed to lower premiums. The #CBOscore shows it sure doesn't lower them if you're 64. 
The CBO report shows what we've suspected all along - #Trumpcare  leaves less Americans covered not more. 
Senate GOP's bill is fundamentally a massive health care cut to give huge tax breaks to the rich. No wonder it won’t fix our hc problems.
@CenterOnBudget: The standard we should holding ourselves to is the current law. This bill is dangerous for millions of Americans.

Tonight you'll hear from @SenateDems speaking out following the #CBOScore of the Senate GOP's healthcare bill: 
The CBO report should be the end of the road for Trumpcare. @SenateGOP should read it like a giant stop sign urging them to turn back.
The CBO score confirms #Trumpcare will lead to higher costs for less care &amp; tens of mils of Americans will be left without health insurance.

If the GOP continues to insist on ramming thru a secret health care bill without any public input they shouldn’t expect business as usual.
.@SenateDems will work on real bipartisan solutions. But @SenateGOP is on a dangerous path crafting this bill in secret.
#Trumpcare is so bad @SenateGOP is trying to switch the blame to Obamacare. It’s not true. It won’t work.
Cutting Medicaid to the bone is mean. Cutting treatment for opioid abuse is mean. Cutting support for people in nursing homes is mean!

This is it. This is not a drill. 7/7
It’s all because Republicans repeated this political slogan – “repeal and replace.” Democrats won’t stand for it. 6/7
If they were proud of this plan they wouldn’t hide anything – they’d crow all about it! What exactly are they trying to cover up? 5/7
Or that their plan would make people pay more for less coverage just so the rich get a tax break. 4/7
Or that their plan would make costs go up and leave millions without health care 3/7
Republicans don’t want the American people to know that their plan has massive cuts to Medicare 2/7

.@SenateDems put fwd a real $1 trillion plan that would create jobs &amp; actually fix our crumbling infrastructure: 
@POTUS It also means that places where they can’t build a toll like in our crumbling schools average Americans will likely get left behind.
.@POTUS' infrastructure plan means #TrumpTolls across America &amp; huge profits for financiers who'll be repaid by avg drivers &amp; citizens.
.@POTUS' infrastructure ‘proposal’ focuses on privatization which really means less construction &amp; fewer jobs particularly in rural areas.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Mr. President if you’re looking for someone to blame you need to look in the mirror. Look at the numbers: 
Given what has happened in Europe we are calling on the President to immediately abandon his proposed cuts in anti-terrorism funding.
#TrumpBudget cuts anti-terrorism funds: 25% cut to UASI an essential prgm to major city police depts like #NYPD-- would make us less safe.
Amazingly with terrorism on the rise President Trump actually proposed cutting vital anti-terrorism funding in his #TrumpBudget last week.
As London events show terrorism is an evil scourge &amp; we must do everything to fight it: rigorous vetting &amp; tightening up is essential.
The United States stands with the citizens of the United Kingdom in our joint fight against terrorists and those who support them.
My heart is with the people of London the victims of this string of terrorist attacks and their families. You are all in our prayers.
And I #wearorange for the Sandy Hook families whose beautiful children's photos in my office remind me daily why we must #EndGunViolence

President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the #ParisClimateAgreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions. 
China treats America far more unfairly than Germany yet @POTUS gives China a pass &amp; lashes out at Germany. What gives?

It was a privilege to know Ray and to work with him. My condolences to his family and all of FDNY.
Just learned that Ray Pfeifer has died. You meet very few truly great men in your life. Ray was one of them.
Glad the Trump Administration reversed course here. 
Thanks for standing strong &amp; reminding NY's electeds that every vote counts esp when it comes to fighting for NYers' health. #Trumpcare. 
DOD has used more time &amp; energy trying to circumvent liability than it has honoring its responsibility to taxpayers &amp; innocent families.

Huge victory for upstate rail passengers - @USDOT grants over $33M to NY for life-saving positive train control! 
For the good of the country GOP should reject this path &amp; work w/ Dems to fix our health care system instead of pulling the plug on it. 
The #CBOScore makes it perfectly clear: unless you’re a healthy millionaire #Trumpcare is a nightmare.
The #TrumpBudget hurts the middle class more than any budget I have ever seen. My colleagues helped me explain why: 
The GOP should drop their dangerous attempts to sabotage health care for millions &amp; work w/ Democrats to improve our health care system.
This Administration’s attempt to hold CSRs hostage is causing health care costs to skyrocket &amp; threatens to leave millions more uninsured.
Once again we are seeing the real world effect of the Republican effort to sabotage our health care system.

Heartbreaking incident in Times Square. As the facts unfold my prayers are with the victims and their families.
Well that escalated quickly. 
Mr. Comey testifying; White House turning over relevant “tapes” &amp; transcripts to Congress; &amp; selection of an ind impartial FBI Director.
The appointment of Mr. Mueller is a great 1st step to getting Russia investigation back on solid ground. These things also need to happen:
I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.
Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual to serve as special counsel in the Russia investigation.
A special counsel is very much needed in this situation and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has done the right thing.

It adds insult to injury that this #WomensHealthWeek the Trump Admin doubled down on cutting funds for reproductive health around the world.
The President owes the intelligence community the American people and Congress a full explanation.
It puts at risk the lives of Americans &amp; those who gather intelligence for our country.
If the Washington Post report is true it is very disturbing. Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous.

.@SenateDems 2. Former FBI Director Comey should still testify before the Senate.
.@SenateDems agree 3 things must happen. 1. DOJs highest serving career civil servant should appoint special prosecutor -NOT Mr. Rosenstein.
@ChrisMurphyCT: McConnell is right - Democrats criticized Comey for mishandling Clinton email case. That's not what he got fired for.
If we don't get a special prosecutor every American will rightfully suspect that the decision to fire #Comey was part of a cover-up.

#Trumpcare would devastate Medicaid a program that covers 68 million Americans.
#Trumpcare would mean insurers could charge older Americans 5 x or more than they charge younger Americans. FIVE TIMES.

.@SenateDems are thrilled the bipartisan govt spending bill permanently addresses miners' health care - is exactly how govt ought to work.
Let's keep up the fight—together. Keep speaking out. Keep the faith. Because in the end equality always prevails in America. #EqualityAct 
If this Administration begins to erode #LGBTQ rights &amp; roll back transgender protections in healthcare they will hear from us. #EqualityAct
Thanks @jimmykimmel for sharing Billy's story &amp; adding your voice to the fight to fund @NIH &amp; ensure coverage for pre-existing conditions. 
News reports of this tragedy are simply heartbreaking. 
@MartinHeinrich: I'm joining @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems at 7PM tonight to mark #ImmigrantRights Day. Watch here:

Congrats to all the NY students who are at @ENERGY's @doescience Bowl in DC. You've got your priorities straight. #ScienceNotSilence 
.@JerryZremski is one of NYs finest reporters. Much deserved recognition for must read series #SDXAwards #Journalism 
Oh &amp; my youngest constituents should know - @SesameStreet (&amp; @PBS) is safe thanks to spending agreement @SenateDems created. 
.@POTUS budget would have derailed #MealsonWheels but @SenateDems kept funds rolling for this year in spending agreement!
Across NY @Cornell @UBuffalo @UofR @Columbia @stonybrooku &amp; more are vital @NIH partners. Increased funds for research a win for all.
Clean up of West Valley nuclear reprocessing site is fed’s responsibility. Secured $66M commitment to protect public health environment.
As #climatechange bring harsher &amp; harsher storms to NY stream gauges will be even more essential. Agreement to invest in them a win for NY.
.@HeadStartgov is one of America's best investments in its future - investing in our children. Funding will be protected in spending bill.
$3B will help fixed-income seniors &amp; lower income NYers cover high energy costs &amp; end agonizing decision of pay bills or feed their family.
Spending agreement ignores Pres Trump's proposed cut &amp; fully funds TIGER Grants allocating $500M for infrastructure in Upstate communities.
Time &amp; again we hear the PTC could make tragic train derailments a thing of the past. Secured $200M to help implement soon.
I’ve fought my whole career to bring more federal resources to our vol &amp; career fire depts - it was essential we lock in $690M for grants.
NY has some of the oldest sewer &amp; water systems in the US; Clean Water&amp; Drinking Water Funds will keep funneling fed dollars to repair them.
Protecting #GreatLakes is vital to NYers' health &amp; the NY economy. Funding Great Lake Restoration Initiative will boost fishing &amp; tourism.
We prioritized funding for opioid &amp; heroin addiction prevention &amp; treatment securing $3.8B for new &amp; existing innovative prgms thru SAMHSA.
Locked in $950M for HOME funds &amp; $3B for CDBG funds to help communities provide safe affordable homes &amp; cont. neighborhood revitalization.
Spending bill – or the #omnibus- is a big win for Democrats the economy &amp; Upstate New Yorkers: 
En #MayDay2017 las comunidades en EEUU se unen contra los ataques del Pdte. y el GOP a los inmigrantes trabajadores y musulmanes.

This #MayDay2017 communities across the US are coming together to fight back against POTUS’ &amp; GOP's attacks on immigrants workers Muslims.
Millions of immigrants come to the US looking for a better life for their family. They're being targeted &amp; attacked in unprecedented ways.

Since taking office Pres Trump has #brokenpromises to working Americans — and now they’re paying the price. More:

I'll be LIVE soon w/ @ChrisVanHollen &amp; @HouseDemocratstalking about #Trump100Days of #BrokenPromises to Americans.  
Completely agree. Puerto Ricans' health care is as impt as any other American’s –ALL electeds should see that: 
@ProPublica: 1/ The @WhiteHouse just sent this out touting “100 Days of Accountability.” We have a few problems with it. 
It is vital that any study on aluminum is followed by strong action against China - not just talk. And that @POTUS addresses it w/ the @wto
I welcome Pres Trump’s effort to join our fight to crack down on unfair Chinese trade practices that hurt American aluminum producers.
The aluminum we use for our buildings planes cars &amp; trucks should be #MadeinUSA &amp; more should come from NY companies like Alcoa &amp; Novelis.
Join me LIVE w/ an update on the state of budget negotiations President Trump's #taxplan &amp; the latest on #TrumpCare 
.@POTUS In fact the prime beneficiaries of the Trump tax plan would be his Cabinet. #DraintheSwamp #BrokenPromise
Yesterday @POTUS released his plan to change the U.S. tax code &amp; his priorities are clear: give a massive tax break to the very wealthy.
President Trump has undercut the great conservation legacy started by Teddy Roosevelt to protect these #MonumentsforAll Americans.
Today’s EO on National Monuments -the GOP's latest attack on our #publiclands -puts at risk some of America’s most extraordinary places.
"""Absolutely"" not. "
Neither the American ppl nor Democrats will tolerate the FCC conspiring w/ industry insiders to roll back critical consumer protections.
Big cable may cheer on the FCC but I'm confident millions of Americans who weighed in on #OpenInternet will again make their voices heard.
Instead it just creates an aggravating experience for consumers &amp; potentially bank-breaking consequences for American start-ups.
Chairman Pai’s action will do nothing to invigorate our economy or spark innovation.
Today FCC chairman announced a dramatic step in the wrong direction for the future of the internet w/ his plans to unravel net neutrality.
@FoxBusiness: Senator Schumer's statement on President #Trump's tax plan 
@nwlc: The federal minimum wage hasn't budged in nearly 8 years. It's way past time to #raisethewage. 
.@POTUS Very wealthy are doing pretty well. God bless 'em. But they dont need a tax break while working class Americans need help staying afloat.
Today we'll hear @POTUS's tax plan. We'll look at it but if gives a huge tax break to the very wealthy that won't pass muster w/ Democrats.

Invertir en la infraestructura de EEUU crea empleos. Los @SenateDems tenemos un plan. ¿En dónde está el plan del Pdte? #PromesasRotas
Investing in America's infrastructure is a tried &amp; true job creator. @SenateDems have a plan. Where’s @POTUS’? #BrokenPromises #Trump100days
Fixing our tunnels roads &amp; bridges water &amp; sewer VA hospitals &amp; more. That’s what Dems have been fighting for during #Trump100Days. 
Remember Candidate Trump promised to fix America’s crumbling infrastructure pledging a $1 trillion-plan to do it.
President Trump said he was going to be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” So far a #BrokenPromise in #Trump100Days.
As we quickly approach the #Trump100days mark it’s a good time to look back on what this Administration has &amp; has not accomplished.
Been fighting for NY dairy farmers on this. Glad to see @POTUS join our fight to change Canada's unfair policy that undercuts our farmers. 
Good for the US that @POTUS is taking the wall off the table in negotiations. Now negotiators can continue working on outstanding issues.
I spent the past two weeks traveling Upstate and it was perfect. So was this bowler in Cortland: 
Democrats have long been clear that putting border wall funding in the spending bill is a non-starter. Here's why:

Great jumping on w/ @MassAGO Carol Browner &amp; @LCVoters - the president's #100days show a strong green Congress is needed more than ever.

If @POTUS is serious about #BuyAmerica he should throw his support behind @SenatorBaldwin’s #MadeinAmerica Water Infrastructure Act: 
Until Pres Trump releases his full tax returns a cloud of suspicion will remain &amp; make it much harder to pass tax reform through Congress.
If POTUS is serious about passing real tax reform to help the middle class he should start by releasing his own full tax returns. #TaxDay
Got Qs? This guide can help w/ last minute #TaxDay issues:  does NOT have answers about @POTUS' returns.

Another glaring ex of Pres Trump saying one thing &amp; doing another. Why aren't White House visitor logs being made public? What's he hiding?
Our job is to support families &amp; grow communities. This unnecessary cut for air service would do just the opposite. 
@JoeBiden: When faced with crimes of hate and inhumanity every person of conscience must speak out in support of #LGBT rights 
"""Under congressional rules though money from one bill isn’t deployed to another."" The White House is struggling w/ this concept."
"Step Three: use all of that ""savings"" to cut taxes for big corporations and the wealthy."
Step Two: cut Medicaid and throw millions of children and seniors off their insurance.
Step One: repeal the taxes on the wealthiest Americans that help fund health insurance in the ACA. 
President Trump has finally told the American ppl the truth about TrumpCare. Its really a hidden special interest tax cut plan in 3 steps.

I'm urging the Armed Services Cmte members to ask tough questions during his hearing.
Concerned about Army Secretary nominee Mark Green particularly his history on issues that impact the LGBTQ community.
When POTUS fails to label China a currency manipulator he gives them a green light to steal our jobs &amp; wealth time &amp; time again.
China steals our IP doesn’t let American comps compete in China &amp; has manipulated their currency causing the loss of millions of jobs.
Unfortunately POTUS' failure to name China a currency manipulator is symptomatic of a lack of real tough action on trade against #China.

11 wks into his administration we have seen nothing from Pres Trump on infrastructure trade or any other serious job-creating initiative.
Disappointing #JobsReport is another example that despite Pres Trump’s populist rhetoric on jobs he is prioritizing special interests.
GOP chose to break the rules &amp; as a result American’s faith in the integrity of SCOTUS &amp; their trust in impartiality of the law will suffer.
The GOP taking the #NuclearOption will make this body a more partisan place &amp; I believe it will make the Supreme Court a more partisan place

@DSenFloor: Sen. Schumer is stating parliamentary inquiries.
Judge Gorsuch has shown he's far from being the kind of mainstream SCOTUS nominee that could earn 60 votes.
But over the course of the hearing in which Judge Gorsuch employed practiced evasions &amp; judicial platitudes the mood of our caucus shifted
Past few wks we Dems have given Judge Gorsuch a fair process – something Merrick Garland was denied. We came to the debate w/ open minds.
Speaking live on Judge Gorsuch's nomination: 
Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy will affect dozens of decisions that could have far-reaching consequences on the lives of avg Americans.
And 3rd based on his record &amp; history Judge Gorsuch has a deeply held conservative judicial philosophy that is far outside the mainstream.
2nd Judge Gorsuch hasn't shown one scintilla of independence from President Trump.
We Democrats have principled reasons to vote against Judge Gorsuch: 1st he has instinctively favored corporate interests over avg Americans.

The United States joins the world in condemning these savage attacks on the Syrian people. They are in our prayers.

That's why @SenateDems came together to write @POTUS urging VETO of #BroadbandPrivacy resolution.
Overwhelming majority of Americans believe that their private info should be just that – private – and not for sale without their knowledge.
Republicans are continuing on their extreme anti-women agenda rushing to roll back a rule that protects family planning providers. 
Taking resources away from #TitleX providers would be cruel &amp; would impact women &amp; families most in need. That's why @SenateDems vote NO.
"In rare ""consumer protection"" vote Senate GOP prioritizes private money managers over Americans trying to save for retirement."
W/out GOP rollback of DOL retirement regs &gt;2M Americans could gain access to new retirement accounts putting them on more stable footing.
Senate GOP now join House in voting to DECREASE the opportunities for the American people to invest in their own retirement.
Senate GOP is creating a false choice – Judge Gorsuch or nuclear option – in an attempt to avoid rules change blame. It just doesn't wash.
In contrast Pres Trump dispatched “advise &amp; consent” pledging to nominate a Justice off a pre-approved list from Heritage Fdn &amp; Fed Soc.
On SCOTUS Pres Clinton sought &amp; took the advice of Republican Judiciary Cmte Chair Orrin Hatch; Pres Obama sought his advice as well.
If Judge Gorsuch fails to garner 60 votes the answer isn’t to change the rules of the Senate; the answer is to change the nominee.
He was a wonderful man and will be missed.

#Trumpcare would've been a boon for wealthy w/ a tax cut for &gt;$250K earners while low income seniors would've seen premiums rise by &gt;$12K.
Pres Trump said we’re going to have health insurance for everyone thats going to cost less. #Trumpcare would have done exactly the opposite.
I’ve never seen a President break as many promises to working people as this President has done in just over two months.
Ultimately the #Trumpcare bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency: incompetence &amp; broken promises.

If anyone doubts Judge Gorsuch could be an activist judge w/ strong consrvt views eschewing interests of avg ppl look how he was selected.
The qualifications for Senate confirmation shouldn't be skillful evasion of questions it's not how the hearing process is supposed to work.
Judge Gorsuch’s testimony yesterday was replete with humble metaphors &amp; homespun stories but pitifully short on substance.
#Trumpcare is not just repealing the ACA it’s taking us even further backwards. More from @AARP  
Is this what the GOP meant when they promised “much lower deductibles” under #Trumpcare?

It’s not unreasonable for Senators to consider &amp; question a nominee's ideology in cmte. But he should be willing to answer specific Qs.
Senators know to ask general Qs to get a sense of a Judge’s philosophy. In our meeting Judge Gorsuch refused to answer even those Qs.

#Trumpcare cuts @PPFA funds hurting millions of women who turn there for mammograms maternity care cancer screenings &amp; more. 
@ChrisMurphyCT: GOP health care plan summarized: Rich people get a huge tax cut. Poor sick and older people pay more: 
#ReadtheBill &amp; you’ll see #Trumpcare caps how much #Medicaid can be spent on your mom's nursing home. 
Simply put #Trumpcare is a mess for the American people. We Democrats will fight tooth &amp; nail to put your access to healthcare first.
@SenateDems: Hear more on #Trumpcare from @SenSchumer @RonWyden @SenatorHassan &amp; @ChrisMurphyCT - watch live now: 
@SenStabenow: About to go to the Senate Floor to talk in opposition the House Republican health care bill. Watch here: 
#TrumpCare will raise premiums &amp; costs on older Americans. #WaronSeniors #ReadtheBill 
#TrumpCare will cost Americans more money for health care while providing fewer benefits &amp; will lead millions to lose coverage altogether.
@maziehirono: #Trumpcare winners: Rich people tanning industry. Losers: hospitals women working families. Talk about a metaphor 
That's just 7 short years away. #Medicare #Trumpcare 
In 8/12 employment discrimination cases Judge Gorsuch sided w/ the employer not the worker. #StopGorsuch 
Does Judge Gorsuch’s anti-worker record mean he'll side w/ conservatives &amp; cut back on the right to organize? I don't want to find out.
&amp; tell Judge Gorsuch: Sympathetic words ring hollow to workers on the losing end of a case denying them benefits or fair treatment.
Trumpcare no reemplaza a la Ley de Cuidado de Salud sino que obliga a los estadounidenses a pagar más dinero por menos cuidado médico.
@SenBobCasey: This would mean cuts for seniors those with disabilities and those with low incomes. Hell no I won't go along with it.
@SenBobCasey: GOP health plan's proposal on Medicaid is a disgrace to our nation and I will fight it with everything I have. 
Trumpcare doesn’t replace the Affordable Care Act - it forces millions of Americans to pay more for less care.
.@HouseGOP plan would cut &amp; cap #Medicaid defund @PPFA &amp; force Americans to pay more all so insurance companies can pad their bottom line.
&gt;1in5 Americans is employed by a company w/ 1 fed contract. If POTUS wants to champion working ppl he'll veto this resolution immediately.
Despite @POTUS' promises to put workers first GOP just voted to revoke requirement for fed contractors to disclose workplace violations.
Each yr tens of 1000s of US workers are denied overtime wage paid unfairly due to age gender &amp; face health &amp; safety risks by contractors.

To be clear this updated #MuslimBan makes us less safe not more it is mean-spirited &amp; un-American. 
Yet another example of the President's immigration policies hurting families this time military families. 
@amprog: Trump's 120 day pause will hurt vulnerable refugees #MuslimBan2 
Americans need to know that this latest Exec Order has absolutely nothing to do with national security. It is still a ban. #MuslimBan2
Despite the Administration's changes the #MuslimBan2 makes us less safe not more it is mean-spirited &amp; un-American.  It must be repealed.
A watered down ban is still a ban.   #MuslimBan2
The American people deserve to know if the #Russia investigation has been compromised by political interference. 
NYPD says anti-Semitic incidents up 94%. Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery is another appalling example. It must stop.

@MSNBC: JUST IN: Senate Minority Leader Schumer says Attorney General Sessions should resign 
@CNNPolitics: Chuck Schumer is addressing AG Jeff Sessions' undisclosed meetings with Russia's ambassador. Watch on #FacebookLive: 
@CNNPolitics: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calls for Attorney Jeff Sessions' resignation  
The revelations are extremely troubling &amp; raise even more questions about the President and his associates’ contacts to #Russia.
The bottom line is we have an obligation to get to the truth. We must evaluate the scope of Russia’s interference in our election.
DOJ Inspector General must immediately begin an investigation into AG #Sessions involvement in the investigation thus far.
If DOJ refuses to appoint a special prosecutor we'll urge GOP to work with Dems to create a new improved independent counsel law.
DOJ must appoint a special prosecutor who is beyond reproach completely impartial w/out any significant ties to either political party.
Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach for the good of the country the Attorney General should resign.
Reports make it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt AG #Sessions cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference in elections
For wks I have said AG #Sessions needs to recuse himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign/transition's contacts w/ #Russia.
I am worried about the future of our country with foreign influence in our elections – it goes to the very wellspring of our democracy.
In light of latest on AG Sessions &amp; #Russia talking re: next steps to preserve integrity of investigation at 10am.

For the 2nd time this YEAR a Staten Island JCC was threatened. They have a music institute a food pantry a senior center &amp; daycare.
Monday a JCC on Long Island evacuated. They host prgms for ppl w/ Alzheimer's &amp; care for infants &amp; teenagers alike. They teach kids to swim.
The SAME DAY another Westchester JCC was threatened. They have daycare &amp; adult special-needs prgms piano &amp; gymnastics class &amp; vol prgms.
Last wk bomb threats were called into MidWestchester JCC. They offer SAT prep lifeguard &amp; babysitting cert art classes &amp; grief counseling.
In Jan bomb threats were called into a JCC in Albany. They host daycare pre-k seniors fitness classes lectures even pet adoption fairs.
This is a no brainer. JCCs host community daycare ctrs after-school prgms &amp; sports facilities. Children are in danger &amp; the FCC must act.
FCC should work with targeted Jewish centers &amp; law enforcement to access caller ID info &amp; help bring criminals to justice..
Perpetrators terrorizing Jewish communities across the US &amp; in New York should not be allowed to hide in the shadows 
Our local JCCs provide so many services to the community at-large &amp; shouldn't be the focus of threats designed to create a climate of fear.
Following threats on JCCs upstate in Westchester LI &amp; Staten Island the FCC must do its part to stop them:

Tonight we hope President Trump will heed the wise words of our 1st President on the power of knowledge and truth. #JointSession 
#ACAworks and the American people know it. When will the GOP get on board? 
Tonight the 45th President will deliver his first address to a #JointSession of Congress. His words will be remembered. 
The President's speech tonight will mean nothing unless he backs up his words of loyalty to working families with real actions.
The #JointSession will mean nothing if the Pres continues to break promises to working people while making it even easier for the wealthy.
Tonight's #JointSession will mean nothing if POTUS &amp; his cabinet of billionaires &amp; bankers continues to govern from the hard hard right.
No community should be the focus of threats designed to create a climate of fear. 
We stand united w/ the Jewish community in Westchester on LI in Staten Island &amp; in every community in America against fear &amp; intolerance.
How will @POTUS govern: like his campaign against both establishments or from the hard right like his VP &amp; Cabinet want him to?
If past is prologue POTUS will use populist rhetoric &amp; talk like he favors working people but his actions will desert them. #JointSession
Populist platitudes will be a dime a dozen at #JointSession Every American should focus on the Pres' actions rather than his empty words.
Rein in #WallStreetProtect retirement savings &amp; #Medicare ↓ mortgage payments ↑ overtime payPush back on China...He's done none of it.
Of the 60 explicit promises POTUS made about his first 100 days only 6 have been kept &amp; 45 have “no action” taken. 
Despite what is said in tomorrow's speech the odds are very high that we’ll keep the ACA. #JointSession #ACAworks #GetCovered
One month into the ACA fight it’s the GOP not the Dems who are in disarray &amp; pointing at one another like an Abbot and Costello show.
Dems are united on ACA while GOP can’t agree on repeal timeline what to replace it with or even if they're calling it “repeal &amp; replace.”

Budget reflects exactly what GOP believes in: helping wealthy &amp; special interests &amp; burdening the middle class &amp; those trying to reach it.
President Trump's budget blueprint takes a meat ax to programs that benefit the middle-class.

#60votes ensures that the #SCOTUS nominee is mainstream bipartisan moderate - exactly what our highest court should be.
#SCOTUS Nominees must demonstrate that they are mainstream enough to earn 60 senators' support. Read more:

Pres Trump's actions raise the bar higher for his SCOTUS nom. Gorsuch's ability to be an ind. check will be front &amp; center in this process.
POTUS's attack on Judge Robart shows a disdain for an ind. judiciary that doesn't bend to his wishes &amp; lack of respect for the Constitution.
Betsy DeVos' privatization agenda isn't just extreme it has been a failure for students. 
Possible my colleagues from other states need more straight talk on DeVos. They should read @Newsday:

60 votes produces a mainstream SCOTUS Justice &amp; the need for a mainstream consensus candidate is greater now than ever before.
There will be 60 votes for SCOTUS confirmation. This is nothing new. It was a bar met by each of President Obama’s nominees.
On an subject as important as a #SCOTUS nomination bipartisan support is essential &amp; should be a prerequisite – which 60 votes makes it.

The Elias Family has been in the US for a month. I asked Hazem what he wants to be when he grows up: A policeman. And his sister: a doctor. 
Still much more work to do; President Trump must overturn this awful executive order.
Those refugees coming here must not be coerced without advice from supporters &amp; advocates to sign ‘voluntary’ deportation orders.
Just off phone w/ Gen. Kelly. Assures me the court order will be complied with. All those still in airports expected to be admitted.
Exec Orders make US less safe &amp; secure; turn much of the world against us. Joining recent refugees today to call on Pres Trump to rescind.
Before the full Senate votes on nominee Rex Tillerson he must say where he stands on these anti-immigrant anti-refugee executive orders.
@GovPenceIN: Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.
These Exec Orders will only serve to embolden &amp; inspire those around the globe who would do us harm. They must be reversed immediately.
We have a long &amp; proud tradition of accepting refugees who seek safety in the US after thorough vetting. That tradition should continue.
Called Sec Kelly to urge the admin to rescind these anti-American executive actions that will do absolutely nothing to improve our safety.
Finally! Someone on the other side broke the silence. Who will speak up next?

Medicare is one of the most successful govt programs ever created. To GOP colleagues considering this path @SenateDems say: make our day.

I hope the House will quickly follow suit on #JASTA so that the 9/11 families &amp; other victims can have the day in court they deserve.
Overriding a veto is something I don’t take lightly but it was impt that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice.
For 15 yrs the victims of 9/11 have suffered pain &amp; heartache but they should not be denied their day in court or their pursuit of justice.
It has been 15 years since that awful day; a day that changed every NYer every American. We’ll never forget the shock; the fear; the loss.
.@JohnCornyn &amp; I narrowed #JASTA to strike the proper balance between our interests abroad &amp; the rights of our citizens to obtain justice.
This is a decision I do not take lightly. But a #JASTA author &amp; a firm believer in its purpose I believe the Senate should vote to override
Today is an important one for the widows &amp; children of those murdered on 9/11. As always I stand with them. #JASTA
