@FaceTheNation: Tune in this Sunday morning to hear from @SenSanders on tax reform and the trajectory of the Democratic Party. 
Trump's chief economic advisor finally admitted what we already knew: big CEOs are getting incredible benefits form the Republican tax plan. 
While we set aside this day to recognize our veterans we must commit ourselves to keep America’s promise to them every day. #VeteransDay
My Republican colleagues love to say the U.S. has the best health care in the world. Well these Canadians think otherwise and so do I. 
American billionaires love the military and they love schools but they don't want to pay anything to maintain those institutions. 
I’m no historian but I think it’s fair to say that there’s probably never been a president less qualified than Trump.
If that were the case I can assure you the Koch brothers Trump and other billionaires would not be pushing so hard for this plan. 
It's nice to see Republicans in Congress looking out for the people who really matter: their wealthy donors. 
Corporate tax loopholes have become so absurd that one five-story building in the Cayman Islands is “home” to nearly 20000 corporations. 
LIVE: We recently found out a terrible truth about the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. #ParadisePapers  
Canadians tell Americans the truth about health care wait times in Canada: 
Two sisters both had breast cancer. The one in Canada focused on getting better while her sister in America faced mounting medical bills. 
Congress must act now or 2800 community health centers will close and millions will lose access to health care. 
Watch @docdanielle debunk the myth that Canadians have their health care decisions decided by the government. 
Today at the international climate talks Syria joined the Paris Climate Agreement. Thanks to Trump the U.S. is now the only one out. 
There's no good reason why Americans should feel they have to leave our country in order to receive affordable medical care. 
Our pattern of doing nothing after mass shootings must end. Gun violence in America is a major crisis which must be addressed.
The time is long long past for us to put the lives of children and innocent Americans over the interests of the NRA’s corporate backers.
How many tragedies must we witness before Republicans in Congress agree to pass legislation to end this epidemic of senseless slaughter?
@latimes: One year later: Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters and others on the 2016 election  
The key issue of our time is the movement toward oligarchy where a few billionaires control much of the economy. 
.@keithellison breaks down why Trump's tax plan means more yachts homes and political influence for the wealthiest people in this country. 
Before Congress considers a tax bill it must investigate the Paradise Papers. We must end the rapid movement toward international oligarchy. 
Trump has repeatedly reneged on his promises by supporting the wealthy at the expense of working families. 
We won't be distracted from your efforts to give billionaires tax cuts take health care from millions and deny climate change. Do your job. 
Trump must make good on his promise to sign a bill protecting Dreamers. I won't vote for any spending bill without a permanent DACA fix.
Today marks how far into 2017 Latina women must work to make what white men made in 2016. That's a pay gulf not a pay gap. #LatinaEqualPay
Are Republicans telling the truth about Canadian health care? These Canadian patients have the answers: 
Huge tax cuts for multinational corporations and the top 1% backed by the Koch brothers. @SenWarren and I break down the GOP tax plan. 
The Cut Cut Cut Act:✅ Tax cuts for billionaires✅ Tax cuts for corporations ✅ Forces cuts to Medicare Medicaid and Social Security 
These Canadians want Americans to know: having health care as a right is real freedom. 
@RepJayapal: It is a woman's right to choose what happens with her body. It's between her and her doctor—not her her doctor and the GOP…
@CWAUnion: Thx @SenSanders for standing w/working ppl against the GOP Tax Plan. We need real tax reform that creates jobs &amp; raises wages…
The top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Republicans say that's not enough. 40% of their tax breaks go to the top 0.1%.
Only 12% of Americans believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut. So of course Republicans are trying to give the wealthy a huge tax cut.
@taxmarch: TODAY at 1PM: Join us on Capitol Hill as we rally against the Republican tax scam!  
Spread the word: You can sign up for health insurance starting today. Go to  to choose a plan and get covered.
"""Women are already trickling out of the work force and it could get worse with more unexpected pregnancies."""
President Trump must not in any way try to derail or obstruct Bob Mueller's investigation. 
@BostonGlobe: .@SenSanders in @GlobeOpinion: The health care crisis no one is talking about 
About 70% of Puerto Rico still has no power as many as 900 could be dead and thousands need food shelter and clean water. We must help. 
You know what's really scary? Millionaires and billionaires using their wealth and power to undermine our democracy. 
A new authorization must be specific about who we are fighting the mission objectives and reporting requirements from the president.
Amazingly Trump is waging war against a group that didn't exist when the authorization of military force passed. 
Thousands die each year because they can’t afford to get to a doctor. The situation must not get worse. We must fully fund the CHC program.
Unless we renew community health center funding 70% of funds will be cut. 2800 CHCs will close. And 9 million patients will lose care.
Community health centers save lives but they also save money. They’ve generated $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system.
CHCs provide affordable high-quality health care to more than 27 million people including primary care dentistry and low-cost Rx drugs.
Millions of Americans are at risk of losing health care because Congress did not renew funding for the community health center program.
There is a lot going on but we need to take a minute to talk about a health care crisis no one is talking about.

Watch @docdanielle debunk one of President Trump's outrageous single-payer myths: 
Are you a student or recent graduate? Apply to be an intern in my D.C. and Vermont offices. The deadline is Nov. 18. 
It is an honor to be with one of our great progressive leaders @NYCMayor fighting for a millionaires tax to fix our infrastructure.
@NYCMayor: I'm with @SenSanders at Fulton Street because it's time for a millionaires tax to fix the subways. 
Russia’s attack on our democracy is of enormous consequence. Trump must not in any way try to derail or obstruct Mueller's investigation. 
Thank you Toronto. I’m proud to join with you in the global fight for universal health care. 
FEMA must determine how through mutual assistance agreements utilities on the mainland can be of immediate help to Puerto Rico.
Gov. Rosselló is right. We must immediately nullify Whitefish Energy’s outrageous $300 million contract. 
@docdanielle: “How free are you if you are one of the 28 mi Americans who can’t afford to go to the doctor if you are sick?” @SenSanders…
Are you truly free if you work 100 hours a week because you can’t find a job with a living wage? Are you free if you have no health care?
How a country deals with health care for its citizens isn't just about about medicine or technology. It's about its core values as a nation.

65% of PR has telecommunications access but there are concerns of a total collapse of wireless service unless enough electricity can return
The level of destruction in Puerto Rico is unprecedented. Rebuilding will require significant resources over a long period of time. 
Only 26% of Puerto Rico has electrical power and around 90% of the U.S. Virgin Islands is still without any electricity.
I want the people in Puerto Rico as well as those in the Virgin Islands to know that they are not alone they have not been forgotten.
Today I am in Puerto Rico to talk with families and local government representatives about the destruction they are dealing with. 
Millions depends on Medicaid for opioid treatment. Trump's solution is to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion. That is a disgrace.
Trump is right that the opioid crisis is a national emergency. Unfortunately his announcement today was nothing more than an empty promise. 
Senate Republicans just gave a massive gift to Wall Street at the expense of everyone else in this country. 
Republicans say they don't want to hurt Medicare. Then why does their budget cut Medicare by hundreds of billions of dollars? 
The Republican budget is disgraceful. Millions will lose health care and thousands will die in order to give tax breaks to billionaires.
@EconomicPolicy: .@SenSanders bill allowing the government to negotiate lower drug prices is an example of real health care reform.

LIVE: Sen. Sanders speaks on how Medicare for all would help businesses and save billions of dollars. 
Republicans say tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations help small businesses. Here’s the truth: They don’t. 
While the United States is the wealthiest country in history we rank 57th in infant mortality. That is an absolute disgrace. 
Republicans love to say that corporations in the U.S. are paying the highest taxes in the world. They are dead wrong. 
.@SenTedCruz said he never called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But Ted we got it on the damn screen. 
This is precisely why I recently introduced the College for All Act: 
Republicans have set the stage to pass tax cuts for the top 1%. We must mobilize to demand their plan is defeated. 
Republicans’ budget is not a bad bill. It’s a horrific bill.
No one should die because they can't afford medication they need. But that's what happens when we let drug makers charge whatever they want.
Gilead one of the greediest pharmaceutical corporations in the world is once again gouging people dealing with life-threatening illness. 
Watch this Danish conservative economist help prove my point: all people should have quality health care higher education and child care. 
@docdanielle: Looking forward to welcoming @SenSanders to Toronto to talk #Canadian #healthcare and #MedicareForAll. 
This is about our priorities as Americans. All our people should get quality health care higher education and child care. #CNNDebateNight 
When Bush was in office he cut taxes for the wealthy and the national debt nearly doubled. Voodoo economics is a fraud. #CNNDebateNight 
Ted Cruz: Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. #CNNDebateNight 
Reagan did slash taxes on the rich in 1981. But the deficit increased so much that he raised taxes in '82 '83 '84 and '87. #CNNDebateNight
When we talk about our national priorities it is not just taxes it's what taxes do for the American people. #CNNDebateNight 
".@SenTedCruz: ""Social Security is a Ponzi scheme"" #CNNDebateNight "
We must send a message to the billionaire class: You can’t get huge tax breaks while children in this country go hungry. #CNNDebateNight 
Republicans love talking about how Reagan enacted a major tax cut in 1981. They fail to mention he raised taxes 10 times thereafter. 
Ronald Reagan's own advisors understand that giving tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals is a disaster. #CNNDebateNight
"Not ""all"" Americans—only the top 0.2% of Americans are affected by the estate tax. #CNNDebateNight "
@SSWorks: If we cut Medicaid by 1 trillion dollars thousands of people will die - @SenSanders #CNNDebateNight #TrumpTaxScam
Well @SenTedCruz makes a great speech about farmers paying the estate tax. Unfortunately it has nothing to do with reality. 
Let's not confuse our campaigns @SenTedCruz. Mine had an average contribution of $27. You received $38 million from three billionaires.

@CNNPolitics: Sanders: “I do want a tax cut for the middle class and working families” but not for billionaires #CNNDebateNight 
If @SenTedCruz doesn't come through for the Koch brothers on these tax cuts he's going to be in trouble. 
"The Republican Party has been calling the estate tax a ""death tax"" for years. The truth is it affects only the top 0.2% "
False. The effective tax rate for large profitable corporations is just 14%. Corporate taxes as a share of GDP are lower than 22 countries. 
Does it make more sense to give tax breaks to the top 1% or rebuild our infrastructure and create 15 million jobs? #CNNDebateNight
The Koch brothers and billionaire donors want these tax cuts very badly. In fact @SenTedCruz just met with them. 
@4TaxFairness: .@SenTedCruz: This tax plan will create jobsFACT: Tax cuts create few jobs. esp. when cutting infrastructure &amp; healthcare
What the entire GOP proposal is about is giving tax breaks to people who don’t need it by making cuts to education housing and health care.
Let me make a prediction: @SenTedCruz is going to tell you that because of tax cuts for the wealthy you will all be rich. That's a lie.
Trickle-down economics is a myth plain and simple. Creating massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations doesn't create jobs. 
The Republican tax plan is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the top 1%. #CNNDebateNight
It's time to debate with Bernie. Tune in now. #CNNDebateNight

@CNN: Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Bernie Sanders to debate tax reform tonight during a CNN town hall 
Who's pushing Republicans to pass tax cuts for the rich that only 12% of Americans support? Their billionaire donors.
I have something to say to Mr. Trump: Tell your Republican friends in the Senate you'll veto this disastrous budget.  
In this budget Republicans want to cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by over $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Disgraceful.
Poll after poll after poll tells us the overwhelming majority of Americans don't want cuts Medicare or Medicaid.
Why are Republicans bringing forth such an absurd budget that is diametrically opposed to what the American people want? Follow the money.
Mr. Trump forgot to tell these truckers in Pennsylvania that only the top 0.2% of Americans would benefit by repealing the estate tax. 
Republicans' budget cuts Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over 10 years – which would throw some 15 million Americans off health insurance.
"Trump and Republican leaders claim their budget gives a ""big league"" tax cut for the middle class. Nothing could be further from the truth."
We must end U.S. support for the disastrous war in Yemen and reassert Congressional oversight. 
@guardian: The Republican budget is a gift to billionaires: it's Robin Hood in reverse | Bernie Sanders 
Congress must act immediately to fully fund the Community Health Center program. CHCs are vital and irreplaceable. 
"@SenateDems: .@SenSanders explains the Trump budget ""would do incalculable harm to tens of millions of working families"" in the Weekly D…"
Amazingly we have a president who is trying to destroy the American health care system. 
Senate Republican’s budget would cut $76 million from the Meals on Wheels program to give tax breaks to the top 1%. 
Congress should listen to what virtually the entire national security community is saying – that the Iran deal is working – and protect it.
Now that this decision has been put in Congress’ hands it’s up to us to stop this drift toward war.
Trump's own top security officials say Iran is meeting its commitments under the deal and that it is in the security interests of the US.
President Trump’s refusal to certify the Iran deal is the latest in a series of reckless moves that make Americans less safe.
This Canadian doctor has seen patients cry happy tears after finding out they would not have to pay for medical care in Canada. 
Our full resources must be brought to bear on the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico for as long as necessary to help our fellow citizens.
We looked into it @realDonaldTrump. It’s called the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. You should check it out some time. 
Let's be clear: the economic theory Trump has embraced trickle-down economics is an abysmal failure and a fraud. 
President Trump talks about bringing back fossil fuels. It’s not going to happen. Solar is the future. 
Instead of spending another $70 billion on the military we could be helping millions of students by making public colleges tuition-free. 
@womensmarch: We are so excited to have @SenSanders join us at the #WomensConvention October 27-29th in Detroit! 
Trump’s tax plan takes from the poor and working families in order to give to the very rich. This disastrous proposal must be defeated.
80% of the tax benefits in Trump’s plan will go to the top 1%. This gift to millionaires will result in huge cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.
Trump's tax plan will provide virtually no benefit to truck drivers and result in a tax increase for millions of middle class Americans.
Donald Trump is in Pennsylvania to tell truck drivers how his tax plan will benefit them. Unfortunately once again the president is lying.
Median Black family wealth: $1700Median Latinx family wealth: $2000Median White family wealth: $116800That is simply unacceptable. 
Trump's announced intention to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement would achieve nothing other than isolating the US.
The Trump administration is putting us on the path to war. Trump’s foreign policy is a disaster and must be stopped. 
@USStudents: “Is it more important to give the rich tax breaks and build more prisons or make college tuition free?” @SenSanders

Thank you @USStudents for organizing students across the country to get involved in the fight for College for All. 
Tonight at 7 PM ET I'm holding a town hall on the need to make public colleges tuition free. Tune in: 
The economic theory Trump has embraced trickle-down economics is a fraud and an abysmal failure. 
In the wealthiest nation we must ensure all Americans regardless of income have access to mental health care. #WorldMentalHealthDay
In the richest country everyone who has the desire and ability should be able to get a college education. 
Tomorrow we start our push to make public colleges and universities tuition free. Tune in at 7 PM ET: 
Making America great is not giving tax cuts to billionaires. It's making sure everyone gets the education they need. 
We must lower the cost of electricity in Puerto Rico and take advantage of its plentiful solar and wind energy to create sustainable power. 
Despite the Trump administration’s destructive efforts we will not stop fighting for women’s rights and full reproductive justice.
This is nothing less than sexism. It's the latest display of Republicans’ total disdain for women’s ability to control their own lives. 
"Republicans say ""We don't want to hurt Medicare."" Then why does their budget cut it by $473 billion? "
The Republican budget contains cuts that will kill people cuts that will hurt people cuts that should not be allowed in a humane society.

By voting for this budget Senate Republicans are voting to slash Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot allow this to pass. 
What are the benefits of a publicly funded health care system? This Canadian doctor explains: 
Now is the time for President Trump to stop his insulting tweets. Now is the time to rebuild Puerto Rico. 
These millionaires want President Trump to know there is nothing patriotic about shifting the tax burden onto the middle class. 
“Bump stocks” provide an effective workaround to convert a legal weapon into an illegal one. We need to ban them and save lives. 
What happened in Las Vegas is a tragedy. But it's one we continue to repeat. We need commonsense legislation to save innocent people. 
"@SenateDems: .@SenSanders: ""In almost every instance this budget ignores the needs of ordinary Americans."" "
The Republican budget cuts Medicaid by over $1 trillion and Medicare by $473 billion over 10 years. Mr. Trump: promise to veto this budget. 
Common sense suggests that we have got to do everything possible to prevent the conversion of semi-automatic rifles into automatic rifles. 
There is no reason for any civilian to own an automatic weapon.
It’s too late for the victims in Las Vegas but it's not too late to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence.
Veterans have been clear that they support strengthening the V.A. not slowly dismantling it by directing resources outside the V.A. system. 
Disgraceful. Pathetic. I have a few things to say about Trump's tax proposal.
Here’s what happens to cities devastated by hurricanes after the cameras leave: 
If you are part of the 99.8% you wouldn’t get a nickel if Republicans repeal the estate tax.  
“Unless you were alive during the 1920s you haven’t seen inequality like this.” –Chuck Collins 
LIVE: Join me and Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies about how we can create a more equal society:  
A free open internet is critical to democracy. We can't allow major telecom companies to have greater control over the information we get. 
Jane and I are deeply saddened to hear that Vermonter Sandy Casey was among the victims in Vegas. Our hearts are with her friends &amp; family. 
It is long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
It should be clear that we have got to do everything we can to stop guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them.
Last night’s attack is the deadliest mass shooting in our country's modern history. This year there have been more mass shootings than days.
I also want to thank the first responders who did an outstanding job responding to this tragedy saving many lives.
My thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and all those wounded in the horrific shooting in Las Vegas.
Let's remember why NFL players started kneeling. They are talking about the need for criminal justice reform and police department reform.
Puerto Ricans are suffering. They are American citizens entitled to the same help as everyone else. We've got to do all we can to help.
What world does Trump live in where it's acceptable to attack the mayor of San Juan while he plays golf with his billionaire friends? 
"""Save Medicare Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it."" –Donald Trump June 16 2015 "
Republicans' budget would cut Medicare by at least $450 billion but would give billionaires including President Trump huge tax breaks. 
@jmillerlewis: ALERT: Republican budget would CUT Medicare by at least $450 billion. 
I will do everything I can to oppose this absurd set of priorities.
We need a budget that reflects the needs of working families not just the wealthy the powerful and large campaign contributors.
This Republican budget was written for the billionaire class for Wall Street for corporate CEOs and for the Koch brothers. 
Why does Norway rank so much higher than the U.S. on health outcomes? These Norwegian doctors explain: 
Who benefits from Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax? Only the top 0.2% — Trump his cabinet and other millionaires and billionaires. 
Cutting taxes on huge corporations doesn’t create jobs. It makes CEOs richer and puts a bigger burden on the middle class. 
You don’t fix a rigged economy by giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires and corporations that rigged it.
Let’s be clear: 99.8% of Americans would not receive a nickel if Trump repeals the estate tax. But millionaires and billionaires would.
The last thing we should do right now is provide 100s of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations.
Watch this Canadian doctor discuss the difference between practicing medicine in Canada versus the United States. 
@glamourmag: Take it from a new mom: Universal health care would mean freedom especially for women.  
Win Butler of @ArcadeFire sat down with a member of Team Sanders to talk universal health care. See what he had to say: 
Trump's tax plan is an absolute disaster. Here's why: 
Should health care be a right? Win Butler of @arcadefire answers:
Meanwhile the Walton family of Walmart has a net worth of $144 billion. This is what a rigged economy looks like. 
It is particularly obscene for Trump to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $269 billion tax break to the top 0.2%. 
At a time of massive wealth and income inequality Trump's tax plan is morally repugnant and bad economic policy.
I would like to thank every single American who came out to fight back and save our health care. You are why we won. 
We must act immediately to end this humanitarian crisis. 
Americans won a major victory. We've stopped another disastrous Republican bill. Now we must go forward and guarantee health care to all. 
@RepRoKhanna: Health care is not a privilege but a right. Thanks @SenSanders for making the case for #MedicareForAll. 
We have led the world in so many ways for so long. But we can't continue to be the only major nation where health care isn't a right.

The Republican bill is opposed by every major heath care organization in America. Our job right now is to defeat it. #HealthCareDebate

We cannot speak with the moral authority the world needs if we do not struggle to achieve the ideal we are holding out for others. #BernieFP
When we see demonstrations of white supremacy we must be unequivocal in our condemnation as our president shamefully was not. #BernieFP
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement was incredibly foolish and short-sighted. And it will also hurt our economy. #BernieFP
It's reasonably easy to overthrow a government. It's far harder to know the long-term impact that that action will have. #BernieFP
Dialogue cannot only take place between ministers and diplomats at the UN. It should be taking place at the grassroots level. #BernieFP
I say to Mr. Putin: we will not allow you to undermine American democracy or democracies around the world. #BernieFP
When the president spoke at the UN he did not mention that Russia tried to undermine our democracy. Well I will: 
When we talk about foreign policy at the very top of our list of concerns is the need to revitalize American democracy. #BernieFP
Sensible foreign policy understands that climate change is a real threat not a hoax and that no country can combat it alone. #BernieFP
Six people own more wealth than half of the world’s population. There is no justification for that. #BernieFP
When people in America march as neo-Nazis or white supremacists we can have no ambiguity in condemning everything they stand for. #BernieFP
If we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad we need to practice those values here at home. #BernieFP
What Eisenhower said over 50 years ago is even more true today. #BernieFP 
Foreign policy is about having a defense budget of ~$700 billion when we spend more on defense than the next 12 nations combined. #BernieFP
Foreign policy is about 7000 Americans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan and hundreds of thousands of those countries’ people dying. #BernieFP
We need to begin a more vigorous debate about foreign policy. But we also need a broader understanding of what foreign policy is. #BernieFP

Sen. Sanders lays out his vision of a progressive American foreign policy. Watch live now. #BernieFP 
People who can't afford health care don't deserve to die. It's crazy that we even have to say that.

@RoseAnnDeMoro: .@NationalNurses to host @SenSanders' #MedicareForAll speech in San Francisco! Open to the public: 
#MedicareForAll means middle class families would save thousands of dollars. It’s financially smart and the moral thing to do. 
Our immediate concern is to beat back yet another disastrous Republican proposal to throw millions of people off health insurance.
Insurance and drug companies and Wall Street will devote a lot of money to defeat #MedicareForAll. But they're on the wrong side of history.
Medicare is enormously successful cost-effective and popular. Now is the time to expand and improve it to cover all Americans.
This racist act must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. No one should live in fear in their own community. 
@nowthisnews: Here's why this Canadian doctor supports @BernieSanders' plan for universal health care 
What is a curse is your support for throwing 23 million off health insurance. That's the curse and we won't allow you to get away with it.
No Mr. President providing health care to every man woman and child as a right is not a curse it's exactly what we should be doing.

Trump's decision on DACA is the ugliest and most cruel decision ever made by a president of the U.S. in the modern history of this country. 
America is strongest when we come together and reject xenophobia. Congress must permanently protect Dreamers and reject Trump's bigotry.

Today on Labor Day we must recommit ourselves to bringing all working people together in the fight for a just and humane world.
If Trump ends DACA Congress must act immediately to restore it.
Taking legal protections away from 800000 young people raised in this country is absolutely counter to what we stand for as a nation.
If Trump decides to end DACA it will be one of the ugliest and cruelest decisions ever made by a president in our modern history. 
@USNewsOpinion: Bernie Sanders (@sensanders): Import drugs and save American lives. 
When I talk about moving towards a universal health care system it is absolutely imperative that treatment for addiction be a part of that. 
Cutting taxes on huge corporations doesn’t create jobs. It makes CEOs richer and puts a bigger burden on the middle class. #PayUpCorps
The opioid abuse epidemic in our country is a public health emergency that must be addressed. #EndOverdose 
Thank you @KamalaHarris for your support. Let's make health care a right not a privilege. 
We must understand that substance abuse is a health issue not a criminal issue. Those who need help must be treated with care and dignity. 
To fix a rigged economy you demand that the top one percent and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes.
You don’t fix a rigged economy by making devastating cuts to education Medicaid child care and nutrition assistance.
President Trump you don’t fix a rigged economy by giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires and corporations that rigged it.
Our job today: make sure lives are saved in Houston. Our job tomorrow: understand the role that climate change has played in this tragedy.

Francisco and the thousands of other victims who were subjected to Arpaio's brutality deserve justice. 
Today it is Texas next month it might be Vermont next year it might be Michigan. We are strongest when we stand together.
This disaster reminds us that we are all Americans and that when any community is in trouble all of our resources should be used to help.
Our thoughts are with people in Houston and throughout Texas who are struggling with the devastating flooding brought by Hurricane Harvey.
The thousands of people terrorized and brutalized by Arpaio's illegal actions deserve justice. No one in America should live in fear.
By pardoning Sheriff Arpaio Trump has again made clear he will use the powers of the presidency to defend racism and discrimination.
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage.

@RepJohnConyers: Glad to have @SenSanders at my #TownHall tonight. Watch it LIVE here:  
We have the most expensive inefficient and bureaucratic health care system in the world. That has got to change.
If Republicans are concerned about combatting racism they must end voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering.
The problem was never just Steve Bannon. It was and always will be Donald Trump. 
It's important for every community in America—including those of us in Congress—to take a hard look at the historical figures we honor.
In my view we should not be celebrating individuals who took up arms against the U.S. and defended the horrific institution of slavery.

@guardianopinion: Most Americans want universal healthcare. What are we waiting for? | Bernie Sanders 
In America should working class people have shorter lives because they can't afford the health care they need? 
No Mr. President. This is a provocative effort by Neo-Nazis to foment racism and hatred and create violence. Call it out for what it is. 
Now more than ever we must stand together against those who threaten our brothers and sisters.
While this incident is alarming it is not surprising. Hate crimes and shows of hostility toward minorities have recently been surging.
The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society.
@SecDef19: I spoke with @SenSanders a few weeks ago on how we can avoid military conflict with North Korea 
@StateDept Our job is to work with China and our allies in the region &amp; around the world on a comprehensive diplomatic strategy to address the problem.

Trump’s bombastic rhetoric is not appropriate when we are dealing with the possibility of a nuclear war that could kill millions of people. 
The days of allowing drug makers to gouge American consumers after taking taxpayer money must end. 
We desperately need to address the massive inequality that exists in America today.
This is a rigged economy designed by the wealthiest people in this country to benefit themselves at the expense of everybody else.
Trickle-down economics is a fraud and we will not accept it. It is and it has always been an abysmal failure and a fraud. 
Filmmakers entertainers and even some billionaires understand that a single-payer system is the most effective way to bring down costs. 
We are a stronger country when we stand together and do not let cowardly politicians try to divide us up. 
If it's radical to think that someone working 40 hours a week shouldn't be living in poverty then yes count me as a radical.
The reality is fraud is the business model of both Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. It's not the exception. It's the rule. 
God didn’t decide on 65 as the Medicare eligibility age. We should make Medicare available for every single person in this country.

@mattduss: Here's @SenSanders conversation with @SecDef19 William Perry on how to resolve the nuke crisis with N Korea: 
People do not deserve to die because they cannot afford health care. I cannot make it any clearer than that. Health care is a human right. 
Thank you to the folks in the disability communities the folks in Planned Parenthood and the millions more who stood up and fought back. 
This is only the first step. We must now move forward to guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege.
Thank you to everyone across the country who stood up and fought back. Tonight was a victory for the American people.

Speaking now on the Senate floor about Sen. Daines’ sham single-payer amendment. 
A vote for ‘skinny repeal’ is a vote to take health insurance from 16 million and drastically increase premiums for everyone else.
Today I joined @RonWyden on the Senate floor to expose some of the most destructive aspects of the disastrous Republican health care bill. 
Mr. Trump you are on the wrong side of history. Discrimination has no place in our military or society. We must stand with trans people. 
Reconciliation's function is to adjust spending and revenue not enact major social policy changes. Republicans are abusing this process.
Sorry Mr. President but if you think the Democrats will be held responsible for the failure of the ACA you've got another guess coming. 
Republicans’ health care plans:1-Take health insurance from 32 million.2-Take insurance from 22 million.3-Take insurance from 15 million.
Trump giving a political speech to kids at the Boy Scout Jamboree was outrageous. 
Advocates with disabilities from @nationaladapt protested cuts to Medicaid today in the Hart Senate Building. This takes real courage. 
This is America we are not going to pass legislation that allows thousands of people to die. 
@armandaviram: 'No Cuts to Medicaid!' Disability advocates from ADAPT are sitting in now at the Hart Senate building 
This is a disgrace. It is insulting. And it is undemocratic. 
I really don't want to be on the phone telling any parent that their child might die because of legislation that Republicans might pass. 
I hope Republicans understand the consequences of their vote today. When you take 22 million off health insurance many thousand could die.
Religious leaders have a message for Republicans who are still trying to take health care away from millions of people. 
It's time to stop worrying about Trump's absurd tweets and start worrying about the dangerous legislation he and Republicans are pushing.
The federal minimum wage has not gone up in eight years.  Nobody who works 40 hours a week should live in poverty. #FightFor15 
It is beyond comprehension that we as a nation have not focused attention on the fact that millions of young people can't find work. 
Unbelievably Republicans aren't content with this disgraceful situation. They want to make it even worse. 
Today on the podcast: I talk to @algore about his new film and the fight to combat climate change. 
"No Republican or Democrat knows what will be in the ""health care"" bill they'll vote on Tuesday. How crazy insulting &amp; undemocratic is that? "
The parliamentarian’s decision today proves once again that the process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the ACA is a disaster.
.@algore continues to educate people around the world on the planetary crisis of climate change. We thank him so much for that. 
We all know that politics is ugly but Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer is most certainly not politics as usual. 
It is beyond my comprehension that we have a president who wants millions of people to suffer just so he can score some political points. 
There is a very important issue that almost no one talks about and that is the issue of youth unemployment. 
Thanks to @algore for not only calling attention to the crisis of climate change but also for rallying people around the solutions.

I'm delighted to see the disastrous Republican health care plan won't succeed – a victory for the millions who stood up and fought back.
As Fox News' Chris Wallace says getting to the bottom of Trump's campaign ties to Russia should not be a Democrat versus Republican issue. 
Older Americans should be able to remain in their homes and communities. They deserve to live with dignity and with a sense of security. 
Remember: the change we are fighting for is not radical. On issue after issue the majority of the American people are on our side.
@RevJJackson: He's here! @SenSanders #FeelTheBern! 
In my view we need to guarantee health care to everyone a right not throw millions of Americans off of health insurance.
I hope Trump supporters in rural states understand that what he said during the campaign about standing up for working people was a lie. 
"The latest Republican ""health care"" bill is out. Big surprise: it's still a disaster."
After getting diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer the Medicaid expansion in West Virginia saved Rusty Williams' life. 
My Republican colleagues just love to talk about choice but somehow they want to tell every woman in the U.S.what to do with their bodies. 
Make no mistake about it thousands of Americans every year will die unnecessarily if the Republican legislation is passed.
The Republican bill is fatally flawed and no small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage that it to the country.
"The revised Republican ""health care"" plan is an absolute disaster that will inflict severe economic pain on millions of Americans."
A massive tax break for the wealthy paid for by throwing children the sick and the vulnerable off insurance? That’s morally obscene.

Net neutrality means that everyone has the same access to the same information — that the internet remains free from corporate control.
Yes. We need to improve Obamacare. But the way to do that is not to throw 22 million people off of insurance.

Republicans’ “health care” plan is nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very rich. 
Bernie is live now talking about why we must continue to fight the Republican health care bill.  
Republicans’ health care bill would cause devastating harm to millions of people. We will not allow that to happen.
28 million Americans still don't have health care. What's Republicans' answer? Throw 22 million more Americans off health insurance.
Republicans have constituents who depend on Medicaid to survive. To throw those people off of their health care is shameful.
Life is not just fancy fundraisers. I urge my Republican colleagues: Listen to the health care stories of people like Georganne Koehler. 
The only way to confront the serious challenges we face as a country is to put forward a bold progressive agenda. 
This is not Bernie Sanders talking. Listen to what George W. Bush's former ethics lawyer has to say about Trump Jr.'s meeting. 
"""To constantly wake up to the news that someone is trying to take away my health care it's just devastating."" - Jasmine Jennings "
It is unconscionable that millions of people in the world’s richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.
3) Russia’s meddling in our election. When Trump meets with Putin he must make clear interference is unacceptable &amp; must never happen again.
2) North Korea. Trump should use the G20 to develop a consensus. Real leadership is bringing parties together to de-escalate tensions.
1) Growing global economic inequality. The G20 has a major role to play in making sure the benefits of growth benefit all humanity.
As President Trump attends the G20 summit in Hamburg Germany this week there are three items that should be at the top of his agenda.
A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.
The United States is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Our people should not have to beg for their right to health care.
Republicans should listen to the stories of people like Brenda Dare who need Medicaid to live in dignity. 
Wishing a safe and happy Independence Day to all. 
Fox News may not like it but these are the facts: Thousands of our fellow Americans will die if the Republican health care bill is passed. 
In the short-term to improve the Affordable Care Act we should have a public option in 50 states and lower the Medicare age to 55.
We do not need to throw 22 million off health insurance. We need Medicare-for-all and I will introduce that as soon as this debate is over.
Remember when $15 an hour was radical? Not so radical anymore thanks to people fighting for a living wage. Congratulations Minneapolis!

The Trump-McConnell “health care” bill would slash Medicaid by $2.4 trillion over the next two decades devastating tens of millions. 
"The Republicans' disgraceful ""health care"" bill would do devastating harm to the people of West Virginia and the rest of the United States. "
If one person loses their insurance because of the Republican health care plan that's too many. But 22 million? That’s an abomination.
Any Republican who votes for the health care bill should be ashamed. They are voting to throw their constituents off insurance.
Instead of throwing 22M Americans off health care we should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right.

"Our job now is to make sure that 100% of the American people know what’s in the disastrous Republican ""health care"" bill. "
This is a major victory but it's temporary. Our job now is to rally the American people to stop this awful legislation once and for all! 
The Medicaid expansion saved Rusty Williams' life. Republicans should listen to the stories of people who need Medicaid to live in dignity. 
Given the crisis we have in primary health care we must act immediately and boldly. We must expand community health centers. 
"Speaking now about the Republican ""health care"" plan that takes insurance from 22 million Americans. "
Health care is a human right.
This is what Republicans said about their bill over the weekend. What will they say now that we know 22 million will lose health insurance? 
This bill is immoral. All of us including Republicans whose constituents depend on Medicaid to survive must work to defeat this bill.

The House passed health care bill is the worst piece of legislation I have seen in my lifetime. 
God only knows what cutting Medicaid by $800 billion would do to the children and people with disabilities living in this country. 
New on the podcast: Bernie and @SenWarren take questions about the disastrous Republican health care plan: 
Republicans' process is shameful. It is unacceptable. They owe Americans more. Their plan must never become law.
"How is it a ""health care"" bill when it throws 23 million people off insurance? Cuts $834 billion from Medicaid? Defunds Planned Parenthood?"
I can understand why Republicans don’t want open discussion. The bill they are working on would do incalculable harm to Americans all over.
The same Republicans now think it's fine for their health care bill to be written behind closed doors without a single committee hearing.
And here is what Senator Hatch had to say: 
Here’s what Senator Alexander said back then: 
And oddly enough many of my Republican colleagues said that it was so important and would impact so many people that we needed more time!
We spent 25 consecutive days in session on health reform debating Obamacare. That was the second longest session in Senate history.
Obamacare had roundtables walkthroughs consideration of over 300 amendments and 53 hearings in the Finance committee.
While Republicans secretly negotiate their health care bill let’s look back to the debate over Obamacare in 2009 and 2010.
Apply to be an intern in Sen. Sanders’ office this fall. The deadline to apply is Friday June 23. 
"The truth is that this is not a ""health care"" bill. This is a ""tax breaks for the rich and multinational corporations"" bill."
This health care bill will impact millions and millions of Americans. Yet we have not had one hearing. Republicans should be embarrassed.
I’m speaking on the Senate floor to say to the Republican leadership: what are you afraid of? Bring the bill out.
On an issue that impacts tens of millions of people Republicans don't have the guts to let their health care bill come up for debate.
"@jacobdhorowitz: Forget ""Trump TV"" @SenSanders is quietly building one of the most powerful media outfits in America by me "

Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. 
Our prayers go out for a full recovery of Rep. Scalise the congressional aides and police who were injured. We’ve got to stop the violence.
Why won’t Republicans hold hearings on their health care bill? Maybe they know Americans will ask why they take health care from millions. 
For the sake of our country and the world the Democratic Party in a very fundamental way must change direction. 
Jeff Sessions' appearance raised more questions than answers about Trump and whether he has tried to derail the Russia investigation. 
I say to Republicans: If you can’t defend your efforts to throw millions off health care to give huge tax breaks to the top 2% give it up. 
Cutting life or death programs in order to give huge tax cuts to the top 1% isn’t a tough decision. It’s an immoral decision. 
It’s long past time that we took a very hard look at our relationship with Saudi Arabia. 
While Americans are dying because they can't afford their medications the 5 largest drug companies made over $50 billion in profits in 2015.
Sec. Mnuchin just said Trump didn't want to reinstate Glass-Steagall. That's not what Sean Spicer said.

What we learned from Comey was deeply troubling. I'm more concerned than ever about Trump’s attempts to derail the Russia investigation.
We must find ways to push back against Iran’s provocative and destructive behavior but threatening the nuclear deal isn't the way to do it.
Donald Trump’s so-called infrastructure plan is a huge giveaway to Wall Street that will fail to modernize our crumbling infrastructure. 
While President Trump continues to reject science these young people are fighting for the future of the planet. 
We shouldn’t be selling our infrastructure to billionaires to make huge profits on the backs of working people.

@rickhasen: ICYMI: Full Bernie Sanders Interview with Me on Voter Fraud Campaign Finance Reform and Gerrymandering 
A political revolution is not going to happen overnight. You don't win on your first shot. But is the momentum with us? Damn right it is. 
"You cannot run a government you cannot make public policy with ""alternative facts."" "
I'm discussing voting rights and campaign finance reform with expert @rickhasen 
We cannot be 'America first' or 'Germany first.' We all have our own interests but we must be an international community. 
Yesterday the U.S. joined Syria and Nicaragua as the third country in the world to reject the Paris climate agreement. What a disgrace. 
Despite Trump's view that he knows more than the scientific community we will move forward to combat the crisis of climate change. 
What President Trump did today by withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord is an international disgrace. 
When climate change is already causing devastating harm we don't have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet.
Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement is an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace.
To the people of Germany and elsewhere in the world: Please don't think that President Trump represents American values he doesn't. 
I grew up in Flatbush Brooklyn in a three and a half room rent-controlled apartment and we never had a whole lot of money. 
Very inspiring. Everyone should read this story.
We must continue to work to aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy and energy efficiency.
No matter what Trump says or does the people of the United States and the world will not turn their backs on this crisis.
If President Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement it will be a horrific mistake.
My message to the graduates of Brooklyn College today was very simple: Help us create the nation that we all know we can become.

We cannot rest until every worker in America has the right to make at least $15 an hour. 
Has the administration estimated how many people would die if 23 million Americans are thrown off of health insurance? 
Why is it more important to give a $100 billion tax break to 3 of the wealthiest families than to feed house and educate 15 million people?
Trump's immoral and pathetic budget would take a major step forward in enacting the Koch brothers’ right wing agenda.

Reminder: This is how Republicans celebrated when they passed this bill that takes health care away from 23 million Americans. 
What a disgrace.
Trump's budget is immoral and it must be soundly defeated. 
When we talk about Trump's immoral budget I want you to think about this: Trump is trying to cut $191 billion from the food stamps program. 
The economic theory Trump has embraced with his budget trickle-down economics is an abysmal failure and a fraud. 
Trump's immoral budget must not see the light of day in Congress. 
Trump’s budget says if you’re a Trump you get up to a $4 billion tax break but if you’re working class you could lose your health care.

Despite Trump's promises Republicans are at it again with their plan to cut Medicaid by $800 billion and take health care from millions. 
What I really like about Mr. Trump is how true to his word he always is. 
What gives me hope right now is this new generation of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. 
Joe Lieberman's political history and extreme views on a number of issues would make him a divisive nominee. That is not what we need now.
The next FBI director cannot be perceived as a political appointee. Unfortunately Joe Lieberman does not fit that description.
We cannot forget the pain of the American people who are struggling economically and do not want the discussion to only be about Mr. Trump.

Mr. President appointing a special counsel is not a witch hunt. It's the right thing to do and your Republican colleagues agree. 
Join Sen. Sanders and Larry Wilmore for a Facebook Live conversation today at 2 p.m. at  
To ensure Americans have confidence in this investigation it must be conducted in a transparent manner and given the resources it needs.
Robert Mueller’s appointment is a positive step. I am hopeful that he will help us get to the bottom of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
@statnews: .@SenSanders outraged over Sanofi Zika vaccine pricing agreement rejection  
Congratulations to the New York State Assembly for moving forward on a single payer health care bill. 
I hate to say this but we have a president who lies all the time. This is not normal. 
We need a special prosecutor to conduct an independent investigation. That's where we are right now. It is a sad day for our country. 
We just had an election. You guys never stop. The American people don't care if I run. They are worried about their health care and jobs.
I'm not a psychologist. But there's something strange going on with Mr. Trump who lies all the time. This is not a typical president.
This is tough stuff. This is not easy. But the bottom line is that there is no doubt that Russia interfered in our election. #CNNTownHall
How does it happen that Mr. Trump shows admiration for a leader who is trying to undermine democracies all around the world? #CNNTownHall
It's imperative that Republicans work with Democrats in an open fair process to get to the bottom of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
We need a special prosecutor to determine whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. #CNNTownHall
Donald Trump wanted to stop the FBI investigation which is the definition of obstruction of justice. We need a special prosecutor.
Starting now: #CNNTownHall with Sen. Sanders and Gov. John Kasich on the crisis facing our country. 
Sen. Sanders will join Gov. John Kasich for a #CNNTownHall on the crises unfolding in the White House. Tune in to CNN at 10.
Now more than ever we need Republican members of Congress to work with us in demanding that Trump be held accountable for his actions.
Now more than ever we need to make sure that the next FBI Director is independent of the Trump administration.
Now more than ever we need to make public any recordings from the Oval Office.
Now more than ever we need a special prosecutor to determine whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. 
Sen. Sanders will debate Gov. John Kasich tonight on CNN. Tune in at 9 ET! #DebateWithBernie 
A week ago Trump fired Comey. Now this. It's vitally important that Trump make public any recordings he has of talks in the Oval Office.
Protecting our national security is one of the most important tasks a president has and Trump is failing at it. 
This is a disgrace. President Trump: Stop rolling back the clock on women’s rights and putting millions of lives in jeopardy. 
99.8% of Americans would not receive a nickel in tax breaks from the repeal of the Estate Tax. 
The US has more people in jail than any country. We must invest in jobs and education not jails and incarceration. 
No president since Nixon has secretly recorded conversations in the White House. If Trump did make recordings they must be made public.
@marycjordan: The painful truth about teeth. 1 in 5 Americans over 65 don't have a single real tooth left:  
When the federal government makes promises those promises must be kept. 
Here's another similarity between Putin and Trump. They're both climate deniers continuing to defend the fossil fuel industry. 
This is a time for bipartisanship and a search for the truth on Trump's ties to Russia. 
@commondreams: Hacking the American Dream: @SenSanders @SenGillibrand Go Big for Worker Ownership  
The purpose of this investigation is to propagate a myth and encourage Republican governors and legislators to increase voter suppression. 
Trump just announced a commission to examine voter fraud. The only problem with that is there is virtually no voter fraud in this country.
The White House is saying we need to move on from the Russia investigation and put it behind us. That is total and complete nonsense. 
At this moment when there's so much distrust it would be a good idea for there to be a 60 vote threshold to confirm the next FBI director.
Did Russia act independently in support of Trump or did the Trump campaign actively collude with them in attempting to win the election? 
Trump’s firing of James Comey at this time was absolutely uncalled for and a threat to the rule of law in our country.
@vprnet: Sanders Calls Trump's Reason For Firing James Comey 'Totally Ludicrous'  
For the sake of our nation democracy and the rule of law it’s time for bipartisanship and a search for truth on Trump’s ties to Russia.
We need an independent investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
It is clear that whomever President Trump handpicks to lead the FBI will not be able to objectively carry out the Russia investigation.
Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey raises serious questions about what his administration is hiding.

It was my great joy to meet with President Jimmy Carter at @cartercenter to discuss the state of human rights in the U.S. and the world. 
I happen to believe health care is a right of all people. Why? Because we are human beings. 
We will take this pathetic health care bill throw it in the garbage can and do something that will work for ordinary Americans instead. 
President Trump is right. The Australian health care system provides health care to all of its people at a fraction of the cost than we do. 
Trump: “I believe in universal healthcare.”Also Trump: Pass my bill that will kick 24 million people off of their health insurance. 
This Republican health care bill needs to either be flushed down the toilet or thrown in the garbage. It's not getting through the Senate.
Let me break the bad news to the President. This health care bill in its current form is not getting through the Senate. No way. 
Yes Mr. Trump the Australian health care system is a lot better than ours and infinitely better than the disastrous bill you supported. 
Thank you Mr. Trump for admitting that universal health care is the better way to go. I'll be sure to quote you on the floor of the Senate. 
"@AC360: .@SenSanders: ""If the bill passed today in the House became law thousands of Americans would die"" "
Donald Trump and Republicans just celebrated voting to let thousands of Americans die so that billionaires get tax breaks. Think about that. 
"The ""health care"" bill that Republicans passed today is an absolute disaster. "
Any Republican who votes for the health care bill should be ashamed. They are voting to throw their constituents off insurance.
Whether the disastrous Republican plan passes today or not we will keep fighting for a single payer system to guarantee health care to all.
It's Thursday Mr. President and your party is trying to throw 24 million people off of health care today. Are you still concerned? 
If one person loses their insurance because of the Republican health care plan that's too many. But 24 million? That’s an abomination.
The health care bill Republicans are trying to pass has $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. Mr. Trump: stop this bill or admit you lied. 
We are not going back to the days where being a woman was a pre-existing condition for which insurance companies could charge extra.
The American people should understand that what Republicans are trying to do to health care today is a disgrace. 
Trump's budget calls for abolishing a program that 6 million low-income Americans rely on to stay warm in the winter. How immoral is that? 
People who stand together can be powerful if they believe they are powerful. 
To say that President Trump's position on climate change is pathetic is a huge understatement.

Our message is simple. We will fight to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy. #ClimateMarch
Cutting carbon pollution emissions by just 32% by 2030 would prevent up to 3600 premature deaths each year.
We must stand up and demand that Congress put people over the profits of the fossil fuel industry.

At a time of massive wealth and income inequality we must do everything that we can to protect and expand pension benefit plans in America.
When a promise is made to working people with respect to their pensions and retiree health benefits that promise must be kept.
This is not just unfair to retired coal miners and their families. It tells the American people that you cannot trust their government.
For decades coal miners contributed into their pension funds with the promise that they would have retiree benefits for a lifetime.
If Congress doesn’t act by tomorrow 22000 coal miners will lose retiree health benefits. We can't let that happen.

Broadband access is a necessity not a luxury. Period.
Trump is the most unpopular president after a 3-month period in our history. Americans clearly aren’t on board with his disastrous agenda.
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage. 
The Democratic Party has got to take the lead and stand up to the billionaire class. 
We must stand with @PplsAction and people all over this country in the fight for justice. Mr. Trump you will not divide us up.

There’s not a single state where someone working 40 hours a week on the minimum wage can afford a one-bedroom apartment. That’s insanity. 
A society which proclaims freedom as its goal as the United States does must work unceasingly to end all kinds of discrimination.
When it comes to issues of national security we need to be putting climate change at or near the top of the list.
I believe our country needs to be a leader on the global stage and that means taking the lead on reversing climate change.
The silver lining of the Trump administration is that millions of people are getting involved in politics for the first time to fight back.

"Mr. Trump promised again and again to help “forgotten"" people. And yet it appears he’s the one who's forgotten them"
When people see the justice of an idea it spreads like fire. It’s time we join the rest of the developed world and guarantee health care. 
In a world of incredible violence the state should not be involved in premeditated murder. We need to end the death penalty.
In a competitive global economy with rapid changes in technology we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
How does a family survive economically if they have to spend half their income on housing? 
There’s no state where a full-time  minimum wage worker can afford a one-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent. That’s unacceptable.
Every American regardless of income must have the right to a higher education.
As a nation we have cheated and lied to the Native American community for far too long.

As the Constitution requires the president must come to Congress to authorize any further use of force against the Assad regime.

If the last 15 years have shown anything it’s that such engagements are disastrous for American security our economy and our people.
I’m deeply concerned the strike in Syria could lead the U.S. back into the quagmire of long-term military engagement in the Middle East.
As the most powerful nation on earth the United States must work with the international community to bring peace and stability to Syria.
Syria’s Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons against the men women and children of his country makes him a war criminal.

I fear that on the Court Judge Gorsuch will be part of an extreme right-wing majority that will attack workers’ rights and women’s rights.
I'm disappointed. A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be bipartisan but McConnell did it in an extremely partisan manner. 
I oppose the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. I cannot support giving a man with his views a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. 
Just what we need. An FDA commissioner who has taken millions of dollars from drug companies. This is a disgrace. 
@AASCU: ICYMI: AASCU's statement on @SenSanders college affordability proposal 
People across the country are coming together to advance a progressive agenda. And it’s working!
Trump said pharma is “getting away with murder.” And now his pick to head the FDA is someone who received millions from drug companies.
Trump promised “insurance for everybody.” Then the Republican health care plan tried to throw 24 million people off their health care.
Trump promised he would stand up to Wall Street. Now it seems like half his administration comes from Goldman Sachs!
Trump promised he wouldn’t cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. Then he filled his administration with people who want to do that.
I cannot understand why President Trump keeps nominating people who hold the exact opposite views of what he campaigned on.
We need millions of students to tell Mr. Trump and the Republican leadership 'Sorry we're not going to leave college $100000 in debt.'

I suggest to Senate Republicans—don't change the rule. Change the nominee.
We need a Supreme Court justice who will protect workers’ rights not just corporate profits. I fear Judge Gorsuch is not that person.
I also believe there's a strong likelihood Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v Wade denying women the right to control their bodies
There is nothing I've seen or heard from Judge Gorsuch to make me believe he is prepared to overturn the gutting of the Voting Rights Act.
@WorkingFamilies: Catch @BernieSanders live right now  
We have one of lowest voter turnout rates. We should be encouraging people to participate in politics not making it harder for them.
Second—it’s not too much to ask that all people eligible to vote should be able to vote without harassment roadblocks and barriers.
Based on my conversation with Judge Gorsuch and a review of his record do I believe he’ll vote to overturn Citizens United? Absolutely not.
The Citizens United decision must be overturned. We must move back to a nation where our political system is based on one person one vote.
As we decide our vote this week on Judge Gorsuch it is important to understand how this vote will impact the American people.

Join me to kick off the push to make public colleges and universities tuition-free today at 3 PM. 
Join me @RepJayapal @SenWarren @keithellison and @USRepRickNolan for the introduction of the College for All Act: 
There is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right. We are going to change that. 
We must remember to think big and have a bold vision. How can we provide health care to everyone? How can we make college affordable to all?
How insane is it for us to literally discourage bright young people from attending college because of how much money their parents make?
Our goal must be to see that young people are ending up in college or in decent jobs—not in jail not dying from drug overdoses.
Trickle-down economics is a fraud and we will not accept it. It is and it has always been an abysmal failure and a fraud.
Our political system is corrupt. Billionaires can spend hundreds of millions to elect candidates who will represent them and only them.
Unbelievably 20 Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom half of America. 20 people! Meanwhile 43 million people live in poverty.
Republicans have nightmares about redistribution of wealth. The truth is we've seen a huge redistribution of wealth—in the wrong direction.
Over 100 years ago workers demanded a 40 hour workweek. Here we are in 2017 and the average full-time American worker works 47 hours a week!

Women in this country have a right to health care and a right to control their own bodies. #IStandWithPP #PinkOut
It is pathetic that the largest oil company in the world understands more about climate change than the president of the United States. 
Despite the disaster of the Trump presidency our progressive ideas are winning. If we keep up the pressure we will transform our country. 
Mr. Trump: You are threatening the lives of our children and grandchildren. We will fight you every step of the way. 
Our job is to save the planet not make more profits for the oil gas and coal industries. We must act boldly to transform our energy system.
Mr. Trump you cannot run a government by rejecting science. Listen to the scientific community not the CEOs of the fossil fuel industry. 
We won a huge victory last week but we must remain vigilant. We cannot allow Republicans to cut Medicaid. 
If we are serious about safe and clean drinking water and air and protecting our families’ health we need to phase out fracking nationwide.
Congratulations to Maryland! Thanks to everyone who stood up and fought for a ban on fracking.
Now more than ever we need to recognize that health care is a right. People who can’t afford health care don’t deserve to die.
What is important is not just that we defeated this disastrous Trump-Ryan health care proposal. It is how we defeated them. 
Far from compassionate Trump's budget — if enacted — would be one of the cruelest in American history. It must be defeated.
The budget could cut as much as $1 billion from Head Start meaning some 95000 children will be thrown out of early education &amp; child care.
His budget eliminates the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program—leaving 1.1 million kids in the streets or home alone after school
His plan puts college more out of reach for her children by slashing Pell Grants and eliminating Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants.
If an eviction notice arrives she won't have a lawyer because this “compassionate” budget would eliminate the Legal Services Corporation.
Trump’s 31% cut to the EPA means this woman’s children would likely be breathing dirtier air and drinking contaminated water.
“Compassion” from Trump for this single mother means $6.2 billion in cuts to affordable housing which could force her out of her apartment.
Let’s look at what Trump’s “compassion” actually means for that mother her two children and millions of other working-class Americans.
"Mick Mulvaney Trump’s budget director claimed draconian cuts in Trump's budget are ""compassionate” for a single mother in Detroit. "
@USATOpinion: From @SenSanders: #Trump’s morally repugnant budget must be defeated 
Somehow in Canada they've managed to provide health care to everyone in their country at about half the cost per person than we do. 
Right now we need to improve the Affordable Care Act and that means a public option. 
The important lesson to be learned from yesterday is that when we stand together we win. Let's continue the fight.
Our victory in defeating the disastrous Trump-Ryan health care plan is the result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back.
Remember: we are still the only major country to not guarantee health care to all its people. We've got work to do. 
Today is a great victory but we have a lot more work to do. We are going to go forward and guarantee health care to all people as a right. 
Our job is to improve the Affordable Care Act not repeal it. Our job is to guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege.
The bill's defeat shows Americans won't accept huge tax breaks for billionaires while 24 million people are kicked off health insurance.
The defeat of the disastrous Trump-Ryan health care bill is a major victory for working families and everyone who stood up in opposition.
Remember. The Republicans' plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is not really a health care plan. It’s tax reform for the wealthy. 
"Trump’s ""health care"" plan is a war against working people. We have to fight back in a way that we have not seen in modern American history. "
Republicans talk a whole lot about choice but want to defund Planned Parenthood where 2.5 million Americans choose to get health care.
"The way to move forward as a country is to guarantee health care for all—not throw millions off health care in the name of “freedom."""
"How can you call something ""health care reform” when 24 million people lose their health insurance?"
I worry that we are moving toward an Orwellian age where words often mean exactly the opposite of what they say. 
We cannot risk a Supreme Court that would put in jeopardy the privacy rights of all Americans and a woman's right to control her body.
Judge Gorsuch refused to answer legitimate questions and brought the confirmation process to a new low in a thick fog of evasion.
Americans deserve a Supreme Court justice who respects the rights of workers instead of bowing to big business. I will oppose Judge Gorsuch.
The good news is that the American people are catching on to Trump's lies. 
Trump’s so-called health care plan is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very richest people. 
"What a shock—among the wealthiest Americans who would benefit from tax cuts in the Republican ""health care plan"" is President Trump himself. "
Paul Ryan said Republicans made “improvements” to their so-called health care bill. They did—for the top 2% and pharmaceutical companies. 
"""Trump’s falsehoods are eroding public trust at home and abroad."" – @WSJ "
At a time of massive income and wealth inequality the last thing we need is more tax breaks for millionaires. 
We need a SEC Chair who will stand up to Wall Street and end its greed and illegal behavior. Not someone who defended Wall Street.
By choosing Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission Trump has picked a Wall Street lawyer to regulate Wall Street.
NEWS: Sanders: Reject SEC Nominee 
We'll never be able to fix a rigged economic system as long as we allow Wall Street to pour money into our political system.
Ever wonder why Washington puts what's best for Wall Street over what's best for Americans? Here's your answer. 
If Trump is such a tough guy why doesn’t he take on the insurance companies and the drug companies and Wall Street?

Congratulations @SpeakerRyan and @realDonaldTrump! Your Obamacare replacement is worse than no replacement at all.
"The question we ask ourselves should be: ""How can we provide health care to all our people?"" not ""How many should we throw off health care?"""
"The Republican plan to throw 24 million people off of health care sure is a strange way to improve people's ""access"" to health care."
@SenatorLeahy: Joint Statement Of @SenatorLeahy @SenSanders And @PeterWelch On ICE Enforcement Actions In Vermont
The future of drug prices in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off?
The cost of prescription drugs in this country is obscene. We should reduce barriers to importation of drugs from Canada and elsewhere. 
Our job: transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to protect the planet for our kids &amp; grandkids—whether Trump likes it or not.
I say to young people all over this country: Get involved in the political process. We need your energy. We need your idealism. 
If leaders of this country continue to reject science then cities and states and towns will take steps to transform our energy system.
Renewable energy is our future—and people in Vermont and across the country are already working to transform our energy system. 
People are not truly free when they have no health care. People are not free if they can’t afford to live. 
The opioid epidemic is ravaging communities across America. We must focus on prevention and we must focus on treatment. 
When workers rise up and stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
“Access” to health care doesn’t mean a damn thing if you can’t afford it.
It’s time to join the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all of our people. 
Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 24 million people off health insurance. That doesn’t seem like family values.
We already have the largest defense budget in the world by far. We can't cut programs for seniors children and working people to add to it. 
We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly the children the sick and the poor while they reward their billionaire friends.
We should be a country where every veteran who defends this nation gets the health care they have earned and the respect they deserve. 
We’re not going backwards on women’s health care and women’s rights. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.
To the politicians who work to push down the vote by people who may vote against them I say: get another job.
Those of you who have gone to rallies or town meetings: keep showing up keep calling Congress continue to fight. Despair is not an option.
Republicans want to throw millions more people off health care and raise premiums on low-income seniors. We can't let that happen. 
We have millions of people who are leaving school deeply in debt. It's time to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. 
Trump's priorities are exactly opposite of where we should be heading as a nation.
At a time of massive inequality we shouldn't slash programs for seniors children and working people to increase military spending.
Trump's budget is morally obscene and bad economic policy. It will cause pain to the people Trump promised to help.
NEWS: Sanders Statement on Trump’s Budget 
We must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege. 
No evidence of President Obama wiretapping President Trump? I'm shocked! 
President Trump: Stop acting like climate change is a hoax and taking our country back decades by gutting environmental protections.
You can’t be an American company only when it benefits you. You also have to be an American company when paying your fair share of taxes. 
If Trump wants to protect our national security he must recognize that climate change is causing destruction and instability worldwide.
This West Virginia coal miner who voted for Trump agrees: We need universal health care. 
Our job is to stand up and say we are one country. We don’t need to give tax breaks to billionaires we need to invest in working people. 
.@WaysandMeansGOP Fixed it for you. 
Out of 188 countries on earth the U.S and Papa New Guinea are the only two that don’t provide some form of paid maternity leave.

Throwing 24 million Americans off health insurance raising premiums and defunding Planned Parenthood is a disgusting and immoral proposal.
Remember this is the wealthiest country in history. We should not have children in poverty. We should not have people without health care.
FDR was right. Now more than ever we have to stay vigilant. 
Are you a low-wage or minimum-wage worker who has struggled to get by? Please share your story. 
The Republican health care plan: less health care for you bigger salaries for health care CEOs. Republican priorities!

Republicans talk a lot about freedom and choice. But you cannot truly be free if you can't afford health care or food or medicine.
@NYCMayor: Let's be clear: pharmaceutical companies peddled these drugs in the name of profit. 
All over rural America people have been ignored for too long. 
"Republicans like to talk about giving people ""access"" to health care. But access to care doesn't mean a damn thing if you can't afford it."
Never lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is not just playing defense. Our goal is a Medicare-for-all single payer system.
The GOP's Obamacare replacement is Robin Hood in reverse. It throws people off insurance and raises premiums but gives millionaires a break.
"The Republican ""health care"" plan is a disgrace. It has nothing to do with health care. It's a $275 billion tax break for the top 2%."
@FaceTheNation: .@SenSanders joins us to talk about healthcare and his views on the GOP's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare 
American consumers should not be forced to pay the highest price in the world for a vaccine we paid to help develop.
In moments of crisis what has happened time and time again is that people have stood up and fought back. That’s happening now. 
On repealing Obamacare Republicans are scrambling they are embarrassed and that tells us they are on the defensive. Keep fighting back.
Our government must stop being pushovers for the pharmaceutical industry and its 1400 lobbyists!

Drug companies aren’t going broke. 89 of the top 100 spent more on marketing in 2015 than on research &amp; development.
Americans should be confident their president is looking out for their best interests not his own personal and family business interests.
Receiving preferential treatment for business interests from the Chinese government clearly violates the Constitution's Emoluments Clause.

We cannot continue to operate under the current system which rewards the wealthiest with more wealth at the expense of everyone else.

"Trump said 3-5 million people voted illegally and that his victory ""was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.” Both lies."
President Trump cannot continue to lie lie lie. It diminishes the office of the president and our standing in the world. 
We have a president who criticizes our allies yet when it comes to the authoritarian president of Russia he has only nice things to say. 
Our job: transform our energy system to protect the planet and also grow our economy in a sustainable way.

Trump must stop spreading lies and hatred toward immigrants and minorities. End of discussion.

If all of you stand up and fight back against corporate greed there is nothing nothing nothing that we cannot accomplish.
Corporations must start treating workers with the respect and the dignity that they deserve. Give workers a seat at the bargaining table.

At a time of grotesque income and wealth inequality we must demand the rich do not get more tax breaks at the expense of the middle class.
It’s time to repeal Kansas' tax breaks for the rich and make the wealthiest Americans across this country pay their fair share in taxes.
Meanwhile Governor Brownback has refused to expand Medicaid denying health insurance to 150000 people in Kansas.
In 3 years over $1.2 billion has been taken out of the Kansas Highway Fund for tax breaks—while 3000 bridges are structurally deficient.
Kansas is spending $350 million less on public schools than 8 years ago adj. for inflation. Some schools are only open four days a week.
Gov. Brownback paid for these tax breaks for the rich by making savage cuts in education health care transportation and infrastructure.
The credit rating of Kansas has been downgraded twice. And instead of creating new jobs Kansas lost 9700 private sector jobs last year.
Instead of going up revenue has gone down by 22% costing the state some $800 million a year.
Gov. Brownback promised his giant tax cuts would pay for themselves and increase revenue. It turns out that was dead wrong.
In 2012 Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed into law one of the largest tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations in state history.
Trump attacks the media all the time because he lies all of the time. It's imperative we all stand up to Trump's drift to authoritarianism.

.@realDonaldTrump They did. It wasn't.

There is no compromise on racism. There is no compromise on bigotry. There is no compromise on xenophobia.
Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.
The ruling class likes to believe this country belongs to them. I think there are more than a few million of us who would say otherwise.
While middle class workers have seen their wages decline the number of billionaires has grown ten-fold in the last 15 years. 
Corporate America and the 1% are not content with the top 1/10th of 1% owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. They want it all.
Trickle down economics is a fraudulent theory designed by the rich and their think tanks to protect billionaires and large corporations.
There is no justice when a small few have enough wealth to support their families for millennia while so many are struggling to survive.
I have run for office many times but I haven't tried to suppress the voting rights of those who oppose me. That is what cowards do.
Our job: Fight back. Expand voter turnout. Overturn Citizens United. Fight gerrymandering. Create a vibrant democracy.
Trump vilifies undocumented immigrants but is unconcerned about the illegal behavior of Wall Street that caused millions to lose their jobs.
"Lincoln said ""Of the people by the people and for the people"" not ""Of the billionaires by the billionaires and for the billionaires."""
To all the people showing up to fight back: what you’re doing is working.
We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by the anti-immigrant and xenophobic hysteria the Republican party has concocted.
As we fight back against this administration we must also celebrate success. People are fighting for a living wage and it’s working. 
Right now if you are poor government turns its back on you yet it welcomes the wealthy and their lobbyists. That is totally backwards.
Pope Francis is right. Health care should not be a privilege only for the wealthy. 
"The real “fake news"" is Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud which is virtually nonexistent and based on zero pieces of evidence."
"The real “fake news"" is Trump and Republicans' denials of the massive planetary crisis we face today in terms of climate change."
It's not acceptable that there are millions of people who work 40 hours a week and yet they're living in poverty.
We must not allow politicians to divide us by where our family came from by the color of our skin our religion or sexual orientation.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
"Good thing we have Donald Trump a pathological liar to tell us the “truth."" "
In Trump's view people should ignore all the news except what comes directly from him. That is what totalitarianism is all about.
Our country is great because we are the sons and daughters of immigrants and I think we should all be very proud of that.
It's important to remember that we not only have massive wealth and income inequality but a power structure which protects that inequality.
Don't let Republicans tell you that we need to cut Social Security. What we really need to do is expand it. 
What are Senate Republicans afraid of? 
@danielmarans: .@SenSanders unveils Social Security expansion bill on the day millionaires stop paying  @HuffPost…
Trumps delusional “voter fraud” talk has an impact. Legislators around the country are getting to work already to suppress the vote. 
Anyone who tells you Social Security is going broke is lying. We can expand and strengthen Social Security if we have the political will.
If you make over $250000 a year you should pay Social Security taxes on all of your income just like middle class workers do.
LIVE: Join me and Rev. Dr. William Barber to talk about building a grassroots movement to fight for justice. 
"@SSWorks: When Republicans say ""save"" #SocialSecurity it's Orwellian language for ""cut Social Security."" - @SenSanders "
@SSWorks: Want to watch a saner press conference? @SenSanders &amp; other members of Congress about to talk #SocialSecurity: 
This is a time we have to strengthen environmental protection. Mr. Pruitt will be working overtime to dismember the EPA.
For the sake of our children grandchildren and the future of this planet Mr. Pruitt must not be confirmed as head of the EPA.
Trump picked the worst group of cabinet nominees in the modern history of America. But EPA nominee Scott Pruitt is the worst of the worst.
.@realDonaldTrump is tweeting about Russia and “FAKE NEWS” again. Here’s why: 
@GoodJobsNation: When we fight we win! Hundreds show up in the snow to fight back against the war on workers. #DefendGoodJobs 
We need a thorough investigation into President Trump's ties to Russia. Here's why: 
Donald Trump must learn that he is nominating a secretary of labor not a secretary of corporate America. 
We don’t need a labor secretary who makes millions while his workers are paid starvation wages.
I'm glad Puzder will withdraw. Given his relationship to his employees he wasn't fit to lead a department responsible for defending workers. 
Pope Francis is right. The federal government must start treating Native Americans with the respect and dignity they deserve. 
@SSWorks: TOMORROW at 2pm @SenSanders &amp; @RonWyden will call for wealthiest to pay their fair share into #SocialSecurity: 
Today I will be asking the Senate Intelligence Committee to thoroughly investigate if Russia coordinated with Trump and his campaign.
We need to know whether our president's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia. 
Human activity is causing the climate to change 170x faster than natural forces. CC: @realDonaldTrump and his cabinet of climate deniers. 
The greed of the pharmaceutical industry has got to end. Marathon must reduce the price of deflazacort which costs just $1000 in the U.K. 
The American people did not vote to pollute the environment. We should not be dismantling protections that ensure clean air and clean water. 
Michael Flynn leaving the administration isn't enough to clear up questions that many of us have about the Trump team’s ties with Russia.
We need an investigation into whether our foreign policy is being conducted in the best interests of America or to protect Russia.
Trump said he would take on Wall Street guys. It turns out that “taking them on” means filling up his cabinet with them. 
Remember when Trump said he was going to drain the swamp. Well the swamp has now overrun Trump's administration and Washington D.C.
Potentially life-saving medication does no one any good if they cannot afford it.
Surprise surprise. Many of Trump's major financial appointments come directly from Wall Street – architects of the rigged economy.
Trump’s pick of Steve Mnuchin to run the Treasury shows he wants to cater to the same Wall Street executives that hurt working families.
We suffer from a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that Trump's policies will make even worse.
Trump is backtracking on every economic promise that he made to the American people. 
It’s standard operating procedure for bullies cowards and demagogues to pick on those who have little power. 
@SenateDems: Our #MondayMotivation to keep up the fight is exposing #TrumpsBrokenPromises. Let's recap the ones on #WallStreet: 
Marathon’s apparent abuse of exclusivity periods and incentives to sell a critical drug for $89k is unconscionable. 
It is outrageous that @MarathonPharma plans to charge $89000/year in the US. for a drug that costs $1000/year in Canada and the U.K.
@OversightDems: @SenSanders @RepCummings blast pharmaceutical company for $89000 cost for old drug  via @business
We are in a pivotal moment in American history. We have a president who is delusional. He is a pathological liar.
I disagreed with President Bush all the time. I never called him a pathological liar. He was just conservative. But Trump lies all the time.
"In conservative and progressive areas people are asking Republicans: ""What are you going to do when you throw 20 million off health care?"""
Donald Trump was going to drain the swamp. Well guess who's running the swamp now: the same Wall Street guys.
We need a transformation of the Democratic Party. We need to make it a party that is very clear that it will stand up to Wall Street.
"To say there were 3 to 5 million ""illegals"" who voted in the last election is delusional. There is zero evidence to back that up."
A month ago Republicans’ message was “repeal repeal repeal” Obamacare. But people fought back. You’re not hearing that as much anymore.
A president who attacks media that makes critical remarks about him as “fake news” does not understand what democracy is about.
A president who attacks a judge who rules against him as a “so-called judge” clearly does not understand what our Constitution is about.
@SenFranken: My Senate colleagues &amp; I call on @FCC @AjitPaiFCC to reconsider decision that will deprive Americans of broadband. 
We cannot continue to build more and more pipelines. Mr. Trump needs to wake up to the reality of climate change. 
We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right through a Medicare for All program.
A president who respected the separation of powers would not have tried to bully a federal appeals court with taunts on Twitter.
A president intent on keeping us safe wouldn't hand over ideological ammunition to terrorists seeking new recruits to kill Americans.
We won’t allow Trump and his Republican allies to destroy Obamacare. Americans are waking up. Republicans beware!
"Trump nominated people with views totally contradictory to what he campaigned on like Rep. Price who wants to “end Medicare as we know it."""
Trump told seniors and working people that they don't have to worry about their future. But his actions now are telling them the opposite.
We don't need an HHS secretary who will end Medicare as we know it. We need an HHS secretary who will protect and expand Medicare.
Hopefully this ruling teaches President Trump a lesson in American history and how our democracy is supposed to work here at home.
Hopefully this ruling against Trump’s immigration ban will restore some of the damage he's done to our nation's reputation around the world. 
Congress must not allow President Trump to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race.
Today’s news that Trump denounced an historic U.S.-Russia arms treaty in a call with Putin is extremely troubling. 
This should concern us all especially as it relates to the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
@SSWorks: We must expand Medicare not destroy it. Tom Price is a step in exactly the wrong direction. - @SenSanders 
We don’t need a labor secretary who makes $10 million a year while his workers are paid starvation wages and live in homeless shelters.
We must stop Republicans from repealing Obamacare. But we can’t just play defense. We need to guarantee health care to all as a right.
I applaud Seattle for ending its relationship with Wells Fargo which is invested in the Dakota Access pipeline. 
I want an attorney general who will fight Republicans trying to suppress the vote. I do not believe Jeff Sessions will be that AG.
We need an attorney general to stand up to the president and explain the Constitution to him. Jeff Sessions is not that person.
Sen. Sanders is speaking now on the nomination of Jeff Sessions for attorney general:
Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. 
You don't ban a senator from participating in debate. Sen. McConnell owes Sen. Warren an apology. This is a fight we'll continue. 
Donald Trump and Republicans are quickly moving us in an un-American and authoritarian direction. This cannot be allowed to take place. 
I think Sen. McConnell owes @SenWarren an apology. It's outrageous she was denied the right to voice her concerns about Jeff Sessions.
Republican senators silencing @SenWarren because she quoted a letter from Coretta Scott King in opposition to Jeff Sessions is outrageous.
When @tedcruz talks about dismantling Obamacare here’s what he’s really telling you. 
We can do better than having millions of people struggle to afford their medication. #DebateWithBernie
In case you were wondering what the Wall Street Journal said about Ted Cruz's Tax Plan: 
"@CNNPolitics: Sanders: ""Access to what?"" ... ""Access doesn't mean a damn thing"" #CNNDebateNight  "
Remember the five largest drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year while 1 in 5 Americans could not fill their prescriptions.
@rosadelauro: Thank you @SenSanders for speaking the truth: repealing the ACA means rolling back coverage for women and expectant mother…
Fact check: Among young adults the uninsured rate has dropped by 47 percent since 2013. #DebateWithBernie 
1.1 million more people would have health insurance today if Texas the home state of @TedCruz had expanded Medicaid. #DebateWithBernie
Reminder: Repealing the Affordable Care Act could kill more than 43000 people annually. 
Access to health care doesn't mean a damn thing. What we are talking about is whether people can afford health care. #DebateWithBernie
Our job is to improve the ACA not simply destroy it and repeal it for political reasons. #DebateWithBernie 
The most popular health care program in America today is Medicare – or what Ted Cruz would refer to as “socialized medicine.”
When 1 in 5 Americans cannot get their prescriptions filled because they cannot afford it that’s called rationing care. #DebateWithBernie
When people don’t have enough money to go to a doctor that’s called rationing care. #DebateWithBernie
It’s about time we join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right. #DebateWithBernie
Fact check: Ted Cruz wants to take away health care from 30 million Americans. #DebateWithBernie 
Republicans are panicking because Americans have caught on that repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement would be a disaster.
We will not go back to the days when being a woman was a “pre-existing condition” because you could get pregnant. #DebateWithBernie
Cruz’s health care plan:✅ Throw 20 million off health care✅ Increase drug prices✅ Deny health care to people with pre-existing conditions
At 9 PM ET I'm taking on Ted Cruz to debate the future of health care in America. Tune in to CNN. #DebateWithBernie 
We must stop the Dakota Access Pipeline uphold our commitment to Native Americans and protect our planet for future generations. #NoDAPL
Once again the government is putting oil industry profits ahead of Native Americans' rights clean water and combatting climate change.
It's unacceptable that Trump and the Army chose to ignore the law and allow construction to be completed on the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
"We need to do more than talk about a ""free society."" We need action to make sure that we live in a free society."
The American people are coming together to stop Trump and Republicans from taking our nation backwards in so many ways. Let's keep fighting!
Vouchers and for-profit charter schools are not the answer for rural America and Betsy DeVos is not the answer for secretary of education. 
We must support public education not allow billionaires to make money privatizing it. We need 1 vote to defeat DeVos' dangerous nomination.
Here's the simple truth. No one can make it on $8 $9 or $10 an hour. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage — $15 an hour.
I hope @SenateMajLdr and Republicans have the courage to tell Trump that this country belongs to all of us and it’s not a one-man show.
Does Trump not know that it is the function of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of executive and legislative decisions? 
It is extraordinary how little Donald Trump knows about immigration or cares about the Constitution rule of law or separation of powers.
Men and women in our military did not stand up and fight for Trump to lead us in the direction of an authoritarian society.
I would hope that Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement to authoritarianism. 
Too many Americans fought and died to defend American democracy to let President Trump move us in an authoritarian direction.
Trump ran for president saying he would take on Wall Street. Now he's dismantling laws that protect Americans from Wall Street’s greed.
I don't mean to be disrespectful but @realDonaldTrump is a fraud. 
American taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize companies like WalMart owned by a billionaire family who pay workers starvation wages.
"Trump has to learn the very important truth stated by Washington AG Bob Ferguson: ""No one is above the law not even the president."" "
I'm heartened by this decision to halt Trump's immigration order which runs afoul of our constitution and who we are as a nation. 
Congratulations to President Trump on his deep spiritual awakening at the National Prayer Breakfast.
"When Republicans tell you that they want to ""save"" or ""strengthen"" Social Security they really mean they want to cut Social Security."
In the face of Trump’s antics we must not lose sight of a progressive agenda and keep working to create an economy that works for all of us.
"We cannot sanction racism sexism homophobia and other forms of discrimination under the guise of ""religious freedom."""
@PostOpinions: .@SenSanders: Will Trump have the guts to stand up to drug companies? 
The 10 highest-paid chief drug industry executives made $327 million in 2015. They get richer while Americans die.
1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their medication. Drugs don’t work at all if patients can’t afford them. 
Betsy DeVos must not become Secretary of Education. We must strengthen public education in America not destroy it. 
.@realDonaldTrump talk is cheap. Do you really have the guts to stand up to the drug companies? 
For these reasons and more Jeff Sessions should not become the next attorney general of the United States. I will cast a strong NO vote.
We need an attorney general who will help fight for comprehensive immigration reform not one of the most anti-immigrant senators.
We need an attorney general who will lead the way in reforming our broken criminal justice system. That is not Jeff Sessions.
We need an attorney general who will help lead the fight against voter suppression. That is not Jeff Sessions.
If one more Republican comes around we can defeat this very bad nomination. Let's hope that happens.
Do any other Republicans worry DeVos may have been nominated because her billionaire family contributed $200 million to right-wing causes?
Is there not one more Republican senator who will stand with the American people against a nominee who wants to privatize public education? 
Taking on Trump will not be easy. We have to be smart about it and we have to stand together. 
What does Trump’s hiring freeze mean? It will be harder for seniors to receive Social Security benefits and the EPA to protect clean air.
The nomination of Mr. Tillerson is one of the worst choices President Trump has made for his cabinet (and he's made a lot of bad choices).
We don't need a secretary of state whose company spent millions denying climate change and opposing limits on carbon emissions.
I was glad to join the boycott of Mr. Pruitt’s hearing. Pruitt is more interested in dismantling the EPA than protecting the environment.
"If Donald Trump would like to investigate what he considers ""voter fraud"" perhaps he should start with his family and advisors. "
"We don’t need an investigation into ""voter fraud."" We need an investigation into voter suppression."
Judge Gorsuch must explain his hostility to women's rights support of corporations over workers and opposition to campaign finance reform.
Is President Trump already selling out the American people and caving to the pharmaceutical industry? 
Not only will the repeal of the Affordable Care Act throw 20 million off health insurance. It will also cost nearly 1.2 million jobs.
.@SenateMajLdr should understand that if he repeals the Affordable Care Act 56000 people in his state of Kentucky will lose their jobs. 
We must strengthen public education in America not destroy it. The U.S. Senate should not approve Betsy DeVos as secretary of education. 
Trump told the American people he would stand up to Pharma. Is he lying again or is he going to work with us? 
This country has always welcomed people into our nation. To tell Muslims they are not welcome runs absolutely contrary to American values.
President Trump's Muslim ban is un-American is unconstitutional and is going to make us less safe not more safe. 
We're not going to shut up. We're going to resist. Stand with @SenateDems tonight at the Supreme Court. 
On virtually every major issue Trump represents a minority of Americans. Our job now is to bring the majority together and fight back.
Democracy means one person one vote. It does not mean billionaires buying elections.
You get one vote. The Koch brothers get one vote + the ability to spend $400 million to elect those who will represent the rich and powerful
When Trump makes delusional statements about voter fraud he's really saying he wants Republican governors to suppress voters more.
We need experienced people who will protect our country on the National Security Council not an extreme right-wing political operative.
Steve Bannon sitting on the National Security Council is dangerous and unprecedented. He must be removed.
Trump's executive order banning entry into the United States is an ugly stain on everything this country is supposed to stand for. 
This country has never been about one person or one president. It's about the millions of people who speak up and fight for justice.
While we fight against Trump's hateful agenda we must push forward a progressive vision demanding our government represents all of us.
Demagogues survive by fostering hatred. We won't allow anyone to divide us up by our religion country of origin or the color of our skin.
Trump's anti-Muslim order plays into the hands of fanatics wishing to harm America. Love and compassion trump hatred and intolerance. 
Puzder is perfect for Trump's cabinet. He's a billionaire pays employees starvation wages and knows nothing about being Secretary of Labor.
On almost every issue Trump and Republicans ignore the views of the people while they follow the dictates of their campaign contributors.
The attacks on abortion rights that we see now would not be happening if 80 percent of the U.S. Senate were women not men.
Goldman Sachs’ president gets a $285 million exit package but no top Wall Street exec has been prosecuted. That’s how a rigged system works.
The American people know climate change is real and a threat to our planet. That’s why they want to aggressively move to sustainable energy.
We don't need a Secretary of State whose company spent millions denying climate change and working to stop limits on carbon emissions.
I will vote NO on the nomination of Rex Tillerson one of the worst choices Trump has made for his cabinet and he’s made many bad choices.
When we fight for sane environmental policy it’s not only the right thing to do it’s what a strong majority of Americans want us to do.
What a shock. Despite Trump's assertions that he would stand up for working people Goldman Sachs is running the the Trump administration. 
"Science is science. There are no ""alternative facts."" A modern society cannot survive unless decisions are made on evidence-based research."
Science is not Democratic or Republican progressive or conservative. Congratulations to @ScienceMarchDC for fighting back.
Congratulations to the winners of the VT State of the Union Essay Contest: Quinn Mayo Musa Mayange and AJ DeFelice
@SenWhitehouse: to tell Pruitt we won't accept his elusive answers. We need an @EPA head who’ll protect our health not polluters htt…
97% of scientists agree climate change is real and that it’s caused by human activity. Denying science is no longer an option. #climatefacts
16 of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. That’s not an alternative fact. That is the truth. #climatefacts 
I will be voting against Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. We must strengthen public education in America not destroy it.
43000 people could die each year if Republicans repeal the ACA. We will not allow thousands to die while billionaires get huge tax breaks.
Does Trump really want to tell our adversaries that if America does it they also have the right to torture captured American soldiers?
Does Donald Trump really want to ignore the advice of U.S. military leaders who vigorously oppose torture? 
Does Trump really want to lead this country into shame and barbarity? Congress and all Americans must defend our values. No torture. 
Our diversity is one of our great strengths. We don’t need a wall. We need an immigration policy designed to unite families not divide them.
Wednesday: 82000 gallons of diesel fuel leak from the Magellan Pipeline in Worth County Iowa. 
Claims of voter fraud have no basis in reality. An analysis of more than a billion ballots found just 31 instances of impersonation. 
Republicans talk about giving people choices. And yet they try to defund Planned Parenthood where millions choose to get their health care. 
Our job is to fight back and do everything we can to protect American democracy from cowardly Republican governors and legislators.
The great political crisis we face is not voter fraud which barely exists. It's voter suppression and the denial of voting rights.
Trump is telling Republicans to accelerate voter suppression to make it harder for the poor young elderly and people of color to vote. 
Friday: 50000 gallons of oil leak on aboriginal land.Tuesday: Trump signs an order to advance two more pipelines.
"@ABC: Bernie Sanders: ""The great political and democratic crisis we face...is not voter fraud it is voter suppression"" "
@SenateDems: Rep Mulvaney: Pres. Trump Hired Me to Cut Social Security and Medicare Despite His Commitments. Watch now: 
This is delusional and nonsensical. The real fraud is that Republicans are changing laws because of so-called voter fraud. 
President Trump: Stop rolling back the clock on women’s rights. Women everywhere must have access to safe &amp; comprehensive reproductive care. 
@SenateDems: Rep Mulvaney says he’ll tell President Trump to break his promise on Medicare and Social Security: 
We can't afford to build new pipelines that lock us into burning more fossil fuels. I will do everything I can to stop Keystone XL and DAPL.
President Trump ignored the voices of millions and put the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry ahead of the future of our planet. 
It seems to me that Rep. Mulvaney is way way out of touch with what the American people want and what President Trump campaigned on.
In May 2009 Mulvaney voted in the South Carolina State Senate for an amendment declaring Social Security and Medicaid unconstitutional.
May 17 2011 Rep. Mulvaney said Paul Ryan’s plan needed to go farther because it did not cut Social Security and Medicare “rapidly enough.”
Aug. 1 2011 Mulvaney said: “You have to raise the retirement age lower a pay out...cannot leave [Social Security] the way that it is.”
"April 28 2011 Rep. Mulvaney said “Medicare as it exists today is finished."""
May 15 2011 Rep. Mulvaney said on Fox Business News: “We have to end Medicare as we know it.”
I’m very concerned Rep. Mulvaney’s nomination means Trump doesn’t intend to keep promises to not cut Social Security Medicare or Medicaid.
We need leaders at EPA &amp; Energy who will stand up to fossil fuel companies &amp; their short term profits. Pruitt and Perry aren't the answer.
You can't claim to defend freedom then vote to allow the government and corporations to collect more information about our personal lives.
We should be greatly troubled by giving power to Rep. Pompeo who has stated that he wants to expand the surveillance state not rein it in.
If Trump is seriously opposed to outsourcing he can lead by shutting down his own sweatshops and paying workers in the US a living wage.
Is Trump already in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution? 
With vast business holdings around the world will Trump's policies work for the American people or his own financial interest?
The repeal of the Affordable Care Act is not an academic debate about health care policy. It is a life and death issue.
How many people are going to die if Republicans take health care away from 30 million people?
Mr. Trump isn't anti-establishment. He and his billionaire friends ARE the establishment and the American people will learn that very soon.
If Mr. Trump is serious about standing up for working families he will tell Republicans to stop trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid.
I found it somewhat amusing that Trump attacked the establishment but right behind him in the VIP section was billionaire after billionaire. 
President Trump you made a big mistake. By trying to divide us up by race religion gender and nationality you actually brought us closer. 
This is not a time for despair but rather a time for action. We are standing up and fighting back. #WomensMarch
Congratulations to the women marching today. We must go forward to ensure full reproductive justice for all women. #WomensMarch
At a time of massive attacks on privacy I will strongly oppose Congressman Pompeo as CIA director.
We must not stop vigorously defending DACA and the young people in that program and fighting for comprehensive immigration reform.
In a cabinet loaded with extremists I hope Gens. Mattis and Kelly will moderate some of the racist and xenophobic views Trump has advocated.
Today will be a tough day but we can't throw up our hands in despair. We have to fight back. We are not giving up. 
The entire First Family represented our country with extraordinary dignity grace and civility over the last eight years. Thank you.
Congratulations to the American Postal Workers Union on their important victory against privatization. 
Wall Street should not be able to gamble with your bank deposits. It is time to pass a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act.
@ajplus: A fossil-fuel ally may end up heading the Environmental Protection Agency 
.@RepTomPrice must learn that a great nation is not judged by how many billionaires it has but how it treats those who are struggling. 
The scientific community is virtually unanimous: Climate change is a global crisis requiring bold action. Rick Perry? He doesn't agree.
We need a cabinet that will take action to combat climate change not deny that it exists and is caused by human activity. 
"""An ObamaCare repeal with nothing good to replace it? That would be tantamount to mass murder."" –Ryan Cooper "
No great country will do well by rejecting science. Mr. Pruitt must not be confirmed as EPA administrator. 
We cannot have an EPA administrator who denies climate science. It is far too late for that.
Scott Pruitt has repeatedly put fossil fuel profits before public health. For EPA administrator that’s unacceptable.
Maybe just maybe we want someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who actually believes in environmental protection.
Will Scott Pruitt a climate change denier who received over $340000 from fossil fuel industries combat climate change? Don't think so.
It's a simple question @RepTomPrice. Do you believe that health care is a right of all Americans whether rich or poor? #PriceIsWrong 
We have to ensure health care as a right not give the wealthy $346B in tax breaks while 32 million people are thrown off health insurance.
85% of Americans support letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. The HHS secretary should side with the American people not drug companies.
Trump claimed repeatedly he wouldn’t cut Medicare. But his HHS nominee Tom Price called for the deepest cuts in a decade. 
@keithellison: We need to fight for a country where everyone has a fair shot and nobody is left behind.My op-ed in @glamourmag:
Republicans often talk about opportunity to go to college or get child care. It's not about opportunity. It's just being able to afford it. 
The Republicans' health care plan would throw up to 32 million more people off health insurance and double premiums by 2026. 
We need a Secretary of Education who actually supports public education. 
Across America quality affordable child care is hard to find. We should be investing in our kids not giving the wealthy huge tax breaks.
Betsy DeVos if you had not given $200 million to the Republican Party do you think you would be nominated to lead the Education Department?
I appreciate @POTUS listening to Puerto Ricans and people worldwide who believe Oscar Lopez Rivera deserves a chance to enjoy his freedom.
Our message to Republicans: Don't throw 32 million off health care. Don't raise the cost of medication. Don't defund Planned Parenthood.
I stand with teachers and students taking part in #ReclaimOurSchools day of action. We need jobs and education not jails and incarceration.
Our goal must be to join every other major country on earth in guaranteeing health care for all through a Medicare for All program. 
One of Dr. King's many great strengths was that he understood change always takes place when millions of people stand up for justice. 
The global economy has simply failed when so many have so little and so few have so much.
Since 2015 the richest top 1% has owned more wealth than the bottom 99% of the world's population.
In the US over the last 30 years the bottom 50% has seen zero income growth. Zero. Meanwhile incomes of the top 1% have grown by 300%.
Eight men now own the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50 percent of the entire planet. If that’s not insanity I don’t know what is.
Over the next 20 years 500 people will hand over $2.1 trillion to their heirs—more than the GDP of India a country of 1.3 billion people.
Inequality is not just a major major issue in America. It has become a global crisis we have no choice but to confront.
@RoseAnnDeMoro: Martin Luther King Jr. recognized healthcare as a human right. The only real healthcare solution is #Medicare4All! #mond…
To honor Martin Luther King Jr. we must fight to carry out his bold vision. He saw the relationship between racism and economics and war. 
I say to politicians: If you believe in what Dr. King stood for stop the voter suppression allow people to participate in our democracy.
While it's easy for politicians to say nice things about Dr. King at the same time they are suppressing the vote. #MLKDAY
@BerniceKing: Senator Bernie Sanders tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. 
"When Republicans talk about ""strengthening"" Social Security what they really mean is cutting Social Security."
Republicans want to decimate programs for working families and give billionaires tax breaks. We must make them own up to what they’re doing.
Let’s not forget that under the Republican plan to repeal the ACA the top 2% will receive $346 billion in tax breaks.
Parents should not have to separate themselves from a baby because they lack the income to stay home. We must guarantee paid family leave.
Workers in every major country on earth are guaranteed paid family and medical leave—every major country except for the United States.
If the Republicans in Congress won't do the right thing for workers we must advance the progressive agenda state by state.
Grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality is not just an American issue. It is a global issue. We can do better. We must do better.
Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement means up to 30 million people would lose insurance. 30 million people. 
.@HouseGOP has a choice: Continue their efforts to cut Medicare Medicaid and Social Security or hold Trump accountable to his promises. 
If the ACA is repealed the wealthiest 400 families would receive a tax cut worth an average of $7 million each. 
While millions of poor children die every year from easily treated diseases the top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 99%.
The business model of Wall Street is fraud. We need real Wall Street reform. We need to break up the huge banks which dominate our economy.
The pharmaceutical industry has far too much power and wealth with their 1400 lobbyists and unlimited sums of money.
We must not forget what FDR told us: 
The health care debate is not politics as usual. It is actual life and death for thousands of people.
As Republicans try to repeal the Affordable Care Act they should be reminded every day that 36000 people will die yearly as a result.
@SenSchumer: GOP said theyd keep the parts of ACA Americans liked. So whyd they just vote down protections for veterans &amp; ppl w/ pre-exi…
It’s not a radical idea to import medication from Canada where they pay a lot less for the exact same drugs. 72% of Americans support it. 
Why do Americans pay so much more than Canadians for prescription drugs? Because the pharmaceutical industry has bought the US Congress. 
85% of Americans favor keeping young adults on their parents' insurance plan until age 26.Only 1 Senate Republican does.
We're the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right. Why are we debating whether to take it away from 30 million people?
Americans should not pay the highest drug prices in the world simply because Congress is bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry.
Happening now: Sen. Sanders address the high cost of prescription drugs. 
35 million Americans – one in five — can’t afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress.
The epidemic of price gouging in the drug industry is an obscenity! The cost of prescriptions has become its own health hazard.
They must allow Americans to buy safe medication abroad which is sold at substantially lower cost and enable Medicare to negotiate prices.
"Trump is right: pharma is ""getting away with murder."" But do Trump and Republicans have the guts to police drug companies and lower prices?"
With or without Mr. Trump we must remain focused. Our job is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.
Trump has a choice. Either he can tell Americans he lied or tell Republicans to back off and not cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid.

27000 Americans will die every year if Republicans succeed in taking health care away from 30 million Americans.
Does anyone think that it makes any sense at all to kick 30 million Americans off of health care and not have any plan to replace it?
Mr. Trump: Keep you promises. Tell Republicans to end their efforts to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
While Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees deny the reality of climate change people throughout the world are suffering and dying.
@realDonaldTrump keep your promises. 
"No Mr. Trump. Climate change is not a ""hoax."" It is real. It is already doing devastating harm to our planet. "
We don't need more tax breaks for billionaires. We need to eliminate student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
Congratulations to newly elected @NC_Governor Roy Cooper for fighting to expand Medicaid for 500000 low and moderate income people in NC.
Don't let anyone tell you that a national health care system where every person is guaranteed health care as a right is a radical idea. 
Republicans' goal is to take away health insurance from millions of people privatize Medicare cut Medicaid and defund Planned Parenthood.
We need to focus less on polls fundraisers gaffes and more on the very serious problems facing Americans. 
Women in this country have a right to health care &amp; a right to control their own bodies. No cuts to Planned Parenthood. We will fight back.
Planned Parenthood mostly helps low-income people. Four out of five of those who benefit are at or below 150% of the poverty line.
Planned Parenthood provides an array of health care to patients across the country. They help over 2.5 million Americans each year.
Abortions are not only legal. They are constitutionally protected a right which was affirmed again in a Supreme Court ruling last summer.
Republicans’ plan has nothing to do with improving health care. They want to defund Planned Parenthood simply because it provides abortions.
Republicans in Congress have returned to their old obsession of trying to defund Planned Parenthood. This is outrageous for many reasons.
Trump has a choice: He can admit he lied or tell Republicans to stop trying to take health care away from millions.

Let's see if Republican senators believe campaign promises matter. If they do there won’t be cuts to Social Security Medicare or Medicaid.
Mr. Trump must make it clear that he'll keep his campaign promises and veto any legislation that cuts Social Security Medicare or Medicaid.
At a time when Republicans are working overtime to cut Medicare Medicaid and Social Security @Reince's statement isn't good enough. 
There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
People should not be dying in the United States of America because they couldn't afford a check-up or a prescription.
A majority of conservatives like the minimum wage and want to see it increased. Republicans in Congress aren’t listening to their voters.
The United States remains the only industrialized nation on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. That must change.
62 people own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world​'s​ population — around 3.6 billion people. 62 people!
African-Americans are almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. That's unacceptable.
Thank you Michelle for your eight years as First Lady in which you represented our country with dignity grace and intelligence. 
People go to the doctor because they're sick get a diagnosis from their doctor but they can't afford the treatment. How crazy is that!
Millions of poor people in America are invisible living under the radar screen. Their suffering is not on our evening news but it's there.
While the five largest drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year 1 out of 5 Americans were unable to fill their prescriptions.
If Republicans get their way 30 million Americans will lose their health insurance 82% of whom are from working families.
A great nation is not judged by how many millionaires and billionaires it has. It's judged by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.
Enough said. 
Mr. Trump must say clearly that he'll veto legislation that cuts Medicare Medicaid or Social Security. He can even do it through a tweet.
@SenatorDurbin: Health care should be a basic right in this great nation. We must work to improve our health care system not dismantle…
House Republicans announced today that they will again attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. What an outrage. We need to fight back.
We cannot allow the Republican Congress to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid or any other program the American people depend on.
Mr. Trump must make it clear that he will keep his word and veto any legislation that cuts Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
@amprog: We agree with @SenSanders. Donald Trump must keep his promise not to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
@SenSchumer: HHS nominee Rep Price didn't just vote on health care bills on the House floor. He championed them &amp; he profited from them.…
While Republicans want to cut Social Security Tillerson just got a retirement package of $180 million. That's what oligarchy looks like. 
Republicans have decided that giving a tax cut to the top 0.1% is more important than the health and economic security of the other 99.9%. 
Millions of people voted for Mr. Trump believing that he would keep his word and not cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
Republicans are trying to pass an extreme agenda that will devastate the working class while only benefitting the top 2% of Americans.
Health care is a right. I hoped Republicans believe that but instead they're trying to take health care away from millions of Americans.
Mr. Trump: Don’t lie to the American people. Tell the Republicans you won't allow them to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid! 
Not only is the Republican plan to take heath care away immoral it violates promises that Trump made to Americans during his campaign.
Either Donald Trump lied to the American people or he's got to say that he will veto any cuts to Medicare Medicaid or Social Security. 
Republicans have decided that giving a tax cut to the top 0.1% is more important than the health of the other 99.9 percent.
In the not-so-distant past higher education was pretty close to being free. In 1965 average tuition at a 4 year public university was $243.
Let me be as clear as I can: It is unacceptable that millions of college graduates cannot afford to buy their first home.
Mr. Trump wants to give huge tax breaks to billionaires. We want to make public universities tuition free. We are right. Trump is wrong.
Our job is to encourage every person in this country to get all of the education they can not to punish them for getting that education. 
Public education in the year 2017 means making public colleges and public universities tuition-free.
If New York makes public colleges and universities tuition-free mark my words state after state will follow.
We must make public colleges and universities tuition free for working families. That is what @NYGovCuomo is fighting for in New York.
@NBCNewYork: WATCH LIVE: Bernie Sanders joins Gov. Cuomo to announce plan to offer free college tuition for middle-income NYers. 
@NYGovCuomo: Live at @LaGuardiaCC this morning for an exciting announcement. 📺Tune in at approximately 10:30 at 
Our message to Mr. Trump is simple: We aren't going backwards. You won't divide us up by race nationality gender or sexual orientation.
I wonder how many members of Congress would vote to raise the minimum wage if they had to live on $7.25 an hour for a year.
Republicans' goal is to take away health insurance from 30 million Americans while giving obscene tax breaks to the 1%. This cannot happen.
Fighting the GOP agenda will require nothing less than a political revolution that engages millions of people from all walks of life.
As we enter 2017 our message to the Republicans is straightforward: you are not going to get away with dismantling our health care system.
It is not utopian thinking to say that every American should have health insurance as a right. It's a reality in many countries already.
If Republicans want to throw millions off insurance cut Medicare defund Planned Parenthood—we will not let them get away with it.
I worry very much about the future of democracy in our country. But I also know there is a strong desire among young people to protect it.
Anybody who knows anything about American history knows the serious issues people have stood up to confront and that's where we are now.
Progress has been made but the fundamental task of taking on the 1% and the greed of the billionaire class still needs to happen.
Greed is a very powerful force​. But ​our vision of a nation &amp; world based on economic social and environmental justice is more powerful.
2017 will be pivotal. Either we'll move toward oligarchy or millions of Americans will stand together for a government which represents all.
Let me take this opportunity to wish all our friends a healthy and happy new year. Let us go forward together in 2017.
The poverty we have today is big enough a problem without climate change making it much much worse.
If the GOP moves forward with their plans then they will have tens of millions of people without insurance or higher premiums to answer to.
The #Fightfor15 started only 4 years ago. But huge progress has already been made because people everywhere see the justice of that idea.
If Mr. Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax is enacted his family and his cabinet nominees would receive a tax break of up to $9 billion. 
I wasn't aware of the part of the Gettysburg Address where Lincoln talked about a country of by and for the billionaires.
When working people stand together we win.  And we are winning the fight for a living wage. #Fightfor15 
It's an indictment of our broken health care system that low-income Americans' their biggest fear is getting sick or being in an accident.
Your constitutional rights don’t depend on your race gender income sexuality or religion. I can’t believe we still have to say that.
Why must we guarantee health care as a right? Because people who can’t afford care deserve to live as much as those who can.
When people put their lives on the line to defend us the president must listen to them not to the Koch brothers &amp; their extreme ideology.
Privatizing the VA would be an insult to the more than 22 million veterans who risked their lives to defend our country. 
NEWS: Sanders Statement on VA 
The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee paid family and medical leave to all workers.
The very rich are getting much richer as the top 1% now earn an average of $1.3 million a year – more than 3 times as much as in the 1980s.
People who need a tax cut are not those who are raking in millions and millions each year but the struggling and frustrated middle class.
Mr. Trump: You told the American people that you would NOT cut Social Security Medicare or Medicaid. Keep your promises. 
The number of Native Americans per capita who are imprisoned is 38% above the national average. This is discriminatory and unacceptable.

There is one major country on earth which does not guarantee health care to all. Yup. You guessed it. It's the United States of America.
3 out of 4 black children will live under the poverty line for at least one year before they turn 18. That’s an abomination.
Young people are our future. It just does not make sense to burden them with enormous debt when they try to get an education.
When will the U.S. join countless other major countries and guarantee our workers a living wage health care and paid family leave?
We are in this together. The truth is on some level when you hurt when your children hurt I hurt. And when my kids hurt you hurt.
It is way too late to have a slew of climate change deniers sitting in powerful cabinet positions.
Those concerned about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy should truly fear the cost of failing to do so as soon as possible.
There is not a single state where working 40 hours/week at the minimum wage is enough to afford a one-bedroom apartment. That's an outrage! 
"Donald Trump the ""anti-establishment"" Republican is building a cabinet worth at least $13 billion. The hypocrisy astounds me."
Republicans claim to want less intrusive government but then they force regulations on women’s bodies.
Oligarchy is not just an American issue it is a global issue. The top 1% of the world's population owns more wealth than the bottom 99%.
There are fair ways to reduce deficits but cutting programs that benefit the vulnerable while giving the rich tax breaks is not among them.
People ask me every day well what do we do now? What you do now is get involved—heavily—into the political process.

Lack of mental health treatment is a major crisis. Less than 50% of adults with mental illness received the treatment they needed last year.

Incredibly just 100 CEOs have more in retirement savings than 41% of all U.S. families.
Those who solely work in the interests of the rich and don't address the needs of ordinary people should not be running this country.
It is not acceptable that hedge fund managers who make millions pay a lower effective tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.

Have you friends or family been addicted to opioids? How has addiction affected you? I want to hear your story. 
We face a major opiate addiction crisis. Drug wholesalers like the McKesson Corporation make huge profits pushing addictive painkillers.

Instead of making mental health treatment more accessible we make the situation worse by dumping many mentally ill people in jail.
Large multi-billion dollar corporations should not make billions pushing addictive drugs.  They should be investigated and prosecuted. 
Trump's 18 cabinet-level appointments hold more wealth than 43 million households combined. So much for taking on the establishment...

We need to change the electoral college.
Trump received 2.5 million fewer votes than Clinton yet he'll soon be president. Clearly in a democratic society this shouldn't happen.
The function of prescription drugs should be to protect and improve human health not make drug company CEOs rich. 
You don’t appoint a cabinet of billionaires if you want to take on the establishment.
The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is fraud. They lie and collude to drive prices up. 
I’ve been criticized for this point so allow me to repeat it: Yes health care is a right of all people.
Republicans’ plan to take health care away from millions of Americans may cause 27000 people to die every year. 
Our Muslim brothers and sisters should not have to fear for their lives every day. We have got to fight discrimination in every way we can.
The future of drug prices in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off? 
Tax burdens should not fall on the middle class which is struggling; it should fall on the wealthy who don’t even pay their fair share.
In 1965 ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay was 20:1. In 2014 it was 303:1. That’s just incomprehensible to me.

@sethmeyers: Tonight I'm joined by @SenSanders who talks Trump Democrats and the future.
The fact is there's been class warfare for the last thirty years but it's been the ruling class taking on the middle class and poor. 
There are enormous economic problems facing the middle class and yet the media and most politicians don't talk about them. 
An enormous amount of fraud takes place in the pharmaceutical industry and one of the major costs of that fraud are American lives.
Mr. Trump is making it abundantly clear that the fossil fuel industry's short-term profits are more important than the future of the planet. 
Very sad. Very dangerous. Mr. Tillerson must be opposed. 
People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they have no health care.
If the Walton family can receive billions in taxpayer subsidies maybe it's OK for working people to get health care and paid family leave.
If you work 40 hours a week at the current federal minimum wage you are making about $15000 a year. That is undoubtedly a starvation wage.
Cutting Social Security a life and death issue for seniors and those with disabilities isn't just bad economics – it's immoral.
A great nation can't simply import the products it uses. We need to re-industrialize America and create millions of good paying paying jobs.
60000 factories in the U.S. have shut down in the last 15 years. Many who lost their manufacturing jobs now earn 60% of what they used to.
Our job is to create a new trade policy which benefits American workers not just the CEOs of large corporations.

I challenge Mr. Trump to tell the American people he'll keep his promises and veto cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. 
The richest 1% in this country now earn 81 times more than those in the bottom half. That’s absurd!

Why won't Republicans support Trump's position that we should lower drug prices by negotiating prices and re-importing prescription drugs? 
We need to make it harder for drug companies to commit fraud. Instead Congress is allowing drug companies to get away with even more fraud. 
I say to Congress: It’s time to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry &amp; stand with the American people who are sick of getting ripped-off.
How can we consider a bill dealing with drug companies without addressing the fact that Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world?
The reality is that fraud is the business model of the prescription drug industry. 
Does Congress have the courage to stand up to big drug companies whose greed is literally killing Americans? 
We do not need a defense budget that is bloated and wasteful. 
In the Trump era we must remember that when we stand together we can accomplish great victories. 
This is not a time for despair. It is a time for being smart and going forward in building a strong and victorious grassroots movement.
These are lessons that must not be lost as we enter the Trump era.  When we stand together we can accomplish great victories.
When faced with a strong grassroots movement led by Native Americans and environmentalists @POTUS did the right thing - and deserves credit.
In defeating the Dakota Access Pipeline we had to take on the entire fossil fuel industry and once again a majority of Congress.

In 2016 we should not continue to trample on Native American sovereignty. And we should not become more dependent on fossil fuels.
I appreciate @POTUS listening to the Native American people and millions of others who believe this pipeline should not be built. 
During the campaign Trump railed against Wall Street. Now Trump nominates a former Goldman Sachs executive to lead Treasury. What hypocrisy!

What are you going to do @realDonaldTrump? Stand up for working people or give the company a massive tax break?

The United States cannot continue being the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.
We are sending a very clear message to corporate America: The era of outsourcing is over. 
I will soon be introducing legislation which fundamentally reforms our disastrous trade policies. Corporate greed has got to end.

.@realDonaldTrump that’s what you told the American people. Keep your word. Work with us to lower drug prices in this country.
In the campaign Trump talked about lowering drug prices by requiring Medicare to negotiate with drug companies and through re-importation.
Many of those people will get sicker than they should have. Some will die.
Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. The result: 1 in 5 patients cannot afford to fill their prescriptions.

.@realDonaldTrump's infrastructure plan is nothing more than corporate welfare.
And then he would allow the companies to “invest” in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks.
Trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes.
Trump's plan to repair our infrastructure is a scam that gives massive tax breaks to large companies &amp; billionaires. 
We say to @POTUS in any  way that you can stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. #NoDAPL 
@SSWorks: Contrary to his campaign promises Donald Trump keeps adding #SocialSecurity advisors who want to gut the system:

Every person is a powerful person if you choose to exercise your power. That power exists 365 days a year not just on election day.
.@POTUS must protect the safety of Native Americans and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
If we don't address climate change there'll be more conflict over limited resources. We must listen to scientists not fossil fuel companies.
For the last 40 years the middle class has been decimated. The rich are getting richer. People are tired of it. They want real change.
If Trump takes actions that we think are unconstitutional or simply bad or unfair we have got to stand up mobilize and fight back.
On issues of racism and bigotry let me be very clear there is no compromise. 
We will stand up and fight back against any attempt to divide us based on our religion. 
@chucktodd: .@SenSanders joins me to discuss his role in the future of the Democratic party. #MTP
People ask me every day “What do we do now?” What you do now is get involved heavily in the political process.
Real change takes place when millions of working people young people and seniors come together to demand a government that works for all.
A president of the United States should not have a racist at his side. Unacceptable.
Many people voted for Trump because they believed he would stand up to the establishment. The truth is he won't. But we will.
We have as a nation traveled too far over the past 200 years trying to fight against all forms of discrimination to go back now.
@SenSherrodBrown: Check out Sherrod's piece on the dignity of work in today's New York Times:

It will be defeated when we stand together against racism sexism homophobia and Islamophobia.

Here is the simple truth. Trump’s reactionary agenda will be defeated when millions of Americans at the grassroots level come together.
The future of this planet is at stake. We have got to bring together people to demand @realDonaldTrump listen to the scientists.

As head of outreach for Senate Democrats my job is to mobilize millions of working people who want a government that works for all of us.

It is time for a new approach to the Native American people not to run a pipeline through their land. #NoDAPL 
We can disagree over issues but racism and bigotry can't be part of any public policy. Bannon's appointment by Mr. Trump must be rescinded.
The appointment by President-elect Trump of a racist individual like Steve Bannon to a position of authority is totally unacceptable.

Trump’s agenda is a minority agenda not supported by most people. Our job is to mobilize and educate and to fight back at every instance.
It is very easy for a president to take on marginalized groups. It’s a little bit harder to take on Wall Street and the drug companies.
We are not going to accept a president trying to divide us up. Our enemies are not our fellow Americans who are Latino or Muslim or gay.
We have got to stand together by the many millions and not allow this country to descend back into racism and sexism and xenophobia.
At a time when we have to aggressively transition away from fossil fuels disastrous projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline must stop. 
Sorry Mr. Trump. The future of the planet is more important than the short-term profits of the oil coal and gas industries. 
Climate change is not a hoax. It’s a threat to this entire planet. Trump better start listening to scientists and not fossil fuel companies.
Steve Bannon’s appointment should make us very nervous. We’re going to tell him and Trump that we will stand together and not be divided up.
On virtually every major issue — raising the minimum wage climate change pay equity for women — we are the majority
Going forward Democrats must pound away on the issues that bring people together and fight vigorously against all forms of bigotry.
We have a president-elect who doesn't believe in climate change. Millions of people are going to have to say: Mr. Trump you are dead wrong. 
If Trump has the courage to take on huge corporations we'll work with him. But if he scapegoats people of color we'll oppose him vigorously. 
People have a right to be angry but we have got to channel that anger against the people who caused the decline of the middle class. 
I hear the cries of families living in fear of being torn apart. We have come too far as a country in combating discrimination to go back.
We must have the courage to take on the greed and power of Wall Street drug companies insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry.
There is no compromise on racism bigotry xenophobia and sexism. We will fight it in all its forms whenever and wherever it re-emerges.
Americans want change but will Trump have the courage to stand up to Wall Street or will he appoint another banker to run the Treasury?
When we stand together and don’t let demagogues divide us up there is nothing we cannot accomplish. 
Today we honor the sacrifice of our veterans and their families but our commitment to veterans must extend to every day of the year.

Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote.
In a democracy the drug companies and the billionaire class should not be able to buy elections.
Enough with cowardly politicians protecting themselves by suppressing the vote. It’s time to ensure that voting remains a right for all.
@lucia_graves: All across America people seem to agree on the awesomeness of Burlingtonians. Here's what we can learn from them 
In 2016 it is embarrassing that women earn 80% of what men make. I know every man will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity
Democracy is not when cowardly governors go out of their way to make it difficult for people to vote.
You can refinance your home at 3%. Why in god's name are people paying 10% interest rates on your student debt?
To the drug companies I say: Stop ripping off the American people. And if you don't do it on your own we will do it for you.
Americans are sick and tired of seeing drug prices soar when the 5 major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.
Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. We are going to raise the minim wage to a living wage.
The billionaire class cannot have it all. This country this government belongs to all of us.
The average price of insulin has gone up by more than 200% in the last 8 years. That type of greed must end. 
The prices of insulin and other diabetes medications have skyrocketed. How have price increases impacted you? 
I ask that the DOJ and FTC investigate whether pharmaceutical companies manufacturing insulin products have colluded in setting prices.
In fact Eli Lilly and other companies have been fined in Mexico for colluding on insulin pricing.
Not only have drug corporations raised insulin prices by double digits overnight – often the prices have increased in tandem.

We should be transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels. The Dakota Access Pipeline if completed will do the exact opposite.
Construction on the pipeline should be stopped until the Army Corps of Engineers completes a full cultural and environmental review.
I am very grateful to @POTUS for listening to Native Americans and their allies who have been protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Republicans should worry less about the drug makers funding their campaigns and more about skyrocketing drug prices. 
The business model of the drug industry is fraud. Glaxo put patients at risk to increase their profits. 
Latina women make only a little more than HALF the amount white men make. That is nothing but sexism and discrimination. #LatinaEqualPay
Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk clearly care more about their profits than their patients. It's time to end their greed. 
In the richest nation in the world diabetes patients are being forced to decide between eating and paying for the drugs they need. 
It makes no sense that the same drug that costs $70 in France costs $450 in the US. We should reduce barriers to importation of drugs. 
Why has the price of Humalog insulin gone up 700% in 20 years? It's simple. The drug industry's greed. 
What you have is an incredibly powerful and greedy industry charging whatever price they want. 
@thenation: Bernie Sanders wants Election Day to be a holiday which would dramatically increase turnout. 
5) The Native American people have been taken advantage of for too long. They have been lied to and exploited. That has got to stop.
4) It is simply unacceptable to build a project like this without the approval of the Native American residents who live there.
3) Oil transported through the pipeline would produce carbon emissions equivalent to 21 million cars or 30 coal plants.
2) The Missouri River provides drinking water for 10 states and 28 tribes. A leak could threaten access to clean water for millions.
1) The pipeline will transport 20 million gallons of crude oil every day. A spill would potentially threaten dozens of bodies of water.
There are many reasons the Dakota Access Pipeline should be stopped. I want to call attention to a few of the biggest. #NoDAPL
Americans pay by far the highest prices for prescription drugs in the entire world. 
We must stand united with our Native American brothers and sisters and say: Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Respect Native American rights.
Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the opportunity to vote.
Americans shouldn't pay higher prices than Canadians for the same drugs simply because Congress is bought by the pharmaceutical industry. 
The greed of Mylan and the entire pharmaceutical industry is out of control. 
The United States owes the Native American people a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. #NoDAPL 
Pharmaceutical industry executives are a bunch of crooks and they're proud of it.

It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.
Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans. That is plainly not debatable at this point.
Considering the planetary crisis we face it is completely inappropriate to continue giving billions in tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.
When scientists tell us that we must transition away from fossil fuels the last thing we should do is drill for oil in the Arctic.
These guys in the pharmaceutical industry in my humble opinion are crooks.

"@b_fung: Sanders: ""We must do everything possible"" to pressure Clinton on AT&amp;T-Time Warner  "
Drug corporations aren't working for the interests of consumers. They'reconcerned about their profits.
Most Americans don’t have millions to spend on lobbying like the drug industry does. That doesn’t mean Congress can just ignore their needs.
It has never occurred to me to deny the vote to people because they might vote against me. People who do that are political cowards.
Actually 89 out of the top 100 pharmaceutical corporations spent more on marketing and sales than on R&amp;D. 
How have drug companies gotten away with charging the highest prices in the world? By spending $300 MILLION a year. 
What democracy is about is all people having the right to participate in the political process—not making it harder for people to vote.
Republicans shouldn’t be able to disenfranchise voters whose political views are an inconvenience to them.
The right to vote is perhaps the most fundamental part of our democracy and must be protected.
Investigators found 31 cases of voter fraud out of a billion votes. That in no way justifies the voter suppression we’re seeing today.
The administration should kill the Time Warner/AT&amp;T merger. This deal would mean higher prices and fewer choices for the American people. 
We have virtually no voter fraud in America. What is the fraud is that people are changing laws because of so-called voter fraud.
1 of 5 Americans age 19-64 cannot afford their prescriptions. Meanwhile the 5 largest drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.
29 American CEOs receive higher salaries than what their companies pay in federal income tax. If you ask me that number should be zero.
By closing loopholes that let companies stash profits abroad we could save taxpayers almost $700 billion. That’s our whole defense budget.
ARIAD's outrageous sales tactics indicate it is more concerned with its profit than with its patients.
Members of Congress can no longer allow the drug companies to charge our people the highest prices in the world. We have to make a stand.

51 million people in this country have no paid sick leave. Not only is that damaging to our economy it is morally wrong. 
Almost everybody understands that we cannot have a vibrant democracy with billionaires buying elections.
It is not utopian thinking to say that every American should have health insurance as a right. It's reality in many countries already.
Students should not have to be hit with insurmountable debt just to get an education. That does not have to be. 
We have a campaign finance system which is undermining our democracy. You must be concerned about the non-sexy issue of campaign finance.
It makes infinitely more sense for our young people to be investing in jobs and education than jails and incarceration.
The United States of America must join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing health care to all its people as a right.
Seniors and disabled veterans need more help than a few extra dollars in their monthly checks. We must expand Social Security. 
I happen to believe health care is a right of all people. Where did that right come from? From being a human being.
At a time when high school graduation rates are at all time highs the next logical step is to make public colleges tuition free.
We have to have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
When people leave college they should be able to start their life with excitement not be saddled with outrageous levels of student debt.

I worry about how many people have got to die because they can't afford their medication before drugmakers decide to stop ripping us off.
While other nations are guaranteeing health care as a right we spend more on our military than the next nine nations combined.
Republicans' plan to end the estate tax wouldn't help working families. It's a multi-billion dollar tax break for Donald Trump's family. 
Wells Fargo’s abuse of its customers is not an aberration.

It is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy.
When we talk about prescription drugs it is important to understand that we pay by far the highest prices in the world.
The birther movement led by Donald Trump was nothing less than racism. Plain and simple.
Freedom of speech in my view does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.
If the United States wants to rebuild the middle class and creating millions of jobs it must also fundamentally change trade policies.
This country is increasing spending on incarceration faster than spending on education. That has to be changed.
Despite the efforts of many Republicans to suppress the vote we must make it easier for people to participate in the political process.

Why is it in this country — the wealthiest country in the history of the world — we’ve got millions of people working for starvation wages?
Seven years after too-big-to-fail banks crashed the economy fraud is still the business model on Wall Street.   
Why do Americans continue to pay the highest prices for prescription drugs when last year just 5 drug companies made $50 billion in profit?
How can politicians talk about morality and family values when we turn our backs on the millions of children and families in poverty?
I have a radical idea for my colleagues. What if we occasionally—we don’t have to overdo it—listening to the people who sent us to Congress?

We need real competition to lower drug prices not corporations offering generic versions of their own drugs for whatever price they want.
At $300 generic EpiPens will still cost 3 times more than they did in 2007. This isn't a discount. It's a PR move. 
We can no longer tolerate a criminal justice system that treats Wall Street executives as too big to jail.
Trade policies should protect not endanger the interests of American workers.
Something’s wrong when the bottom half of families in America holds 1% of wealth and the top 10% holds three-quarters of family wealth.
The next decade of action on climate change is critical. If we do not act boldly we will not be able to avoid catastrophic consequences.
It is beyond my comprehension that thousands of bright young people are unable to go to college only because their family lacks the funding.
Considering the planetary crisis we face it is completely inappropriate to continue giving billions in tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.
Change does not take place easily. Anyone who’s read history understands that.
@LaurenWeberHP: Here's what parents of kids with life-threatening allergies think of the EpiPen price increase 
The future of prescription costs in America comes down to this: Do we have the guts to stand up to drug companies who are ripping us off?
No one in America in should ever have to choose between their medicine and their food and yet millions have to make that choice every day.
The rising cost of prescriptions has become its own health hazard. People literally cannot afford the medicine they need to survive.
No mother should have to send their sick child to school because she can't take a day from work. We need paid family leave in this country.
When workers don't have to worry about how they're going to pay rent they become better workers. Raising the minimum wage is common sense.
We should feel obligated to expand Social Security and protect those people who have worked their entire lives for a secure retirement.
We won’t have a successful economy unless our young people can get the higher education they need regardless of their families' income.
The American people have sent a clear message that they're tired of big corporations sending American jobs overseas.

“The history of the past is but one long struggle upward to equality.” - Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
We must join with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and many other tribal nations to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. 
Pay equity is not a partisan issue but instead an issue of basic fairness. In America there should be equal pay for equal work.
Scientists are no longer wondering if climate change is real or not. What they are saying now is it's happening even faster than predicted.
Wall Street doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Bankers could stand to remember that their greed affects the rest of the people in this country.

Five Years Since Irene Report Warns of Severe Weather Damage From Climate Change 
When the young and the poor don't vote the billionaire class gets to make decisions for them. That's why we have to end voter suppression.
National Parks turn 100 years old this week but if we don't combat climate change they won't last much longer. 
It is not acceptable that as workers have become more productive their wages and benefits have gone down.
Without action on climate change the average 21-year-old college graduate in the class of 2015 will lose over $126000 in lifetime income.
It is time to enact prescription drug policies that work for everyone not just the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry.
Something is very very wrong when drug companies value their profits over the lives of their customers.
Dicyclomine a drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome had its price jacked up by 400%.
They increased the price of metoclopramide which is commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease 444%.
They increased the price of ursodiol a generic medication used to treat gallstones 542%.
The quality of Mylan’s drugs isn’t improving but the company thinks it is acceptable to quadruple their prices.
It’s not just EpiPens. Mylan has raised prices more than 20% on 24 medications and more than 100% on seven medications.
While Americans are dying because they can't afford Mylan's egregious drug prices the company’s CEO got a 671% raise to over $18 million.
It’s not a mystery why drug companies raise their prices to obscene levels. Just look at the multi-million dollar paychecks their CEOs get.
Mylan's greed is apparently limitless. They didn't just raise the price of EpiPens 500% they also dodge U.S. taxes. 
Racism and prejudice are unfortunately alive and well in this country but that doesn’t mean we can’t make progress against discrimination.
Millennials will lose $8.8 trillion in lifetime income because of climate change. We cannot afford to do nothing.
Black women make 60% of what a white man makes. That is nothing but sexism and discrimination. #BlackWomensEqualPay
When we began the idea of $15 per hour minimum wage was seen to be a very radical idea. Now a majority of Americans support it.
Young people with their idealism and energy and intelligence are essential to making America into what it can become.
We can combat voter suppression and increase turnout by ensuring that anyone who is of voting age is automatically registered to vote.
@Salon: Robert Reich makes the case for a single-payer health plan

We may have made a lot of progress but when it comes to racial justice we still have a long long way to go.
If we're going to keep health care costs low every American must have the choice of a public-option insurance plan. 
The immigrant detention machine has perpetuated unjust policies and separated families. It's time for DHS to end its use of private prisons.

My message to Pfizer and the entire pharmaceutical industry is clear: The era of charging unconscionable prices must end.
A life-saving drug does no good if the people who need it cannot afford that drug.
Today Pfizer announced they are buying Xtandi a prostate cancer drug that costs Americans $129000 – 4 times more than in other countries.
One in four people have a difficult time affording their medicine. In the richest country in the world that is unacceptable.
@4TaxFairness: Taxpayers funded a lifesaving drug guess what happened next  via @SenSanders #CorpsPayUp
The kernel of my political views is that change never takes place from the top down. It always takes place from the bottom on up.
A majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It's not only the right thing to do it's what the people want.
Taxpayers should never again be on the hook for the recklessness of Wall Street executives.
Republicans should put politics aside and pass emergency funding to protect Americans from the serious health effects of the Zika virus.
We should not pass trade agreements that are opposed by practically every union which represent millions of American workers.
There is something profoundly wrong when the rich keep getting richer and virtually everyone else gets poorer. 
Next time you hear a politician talk about family values ask them where they stand on paid family leave.
Addressing climate change isn’t just about saving polar bears. It’s about preventing humanitarian crises like mass drought and starvation.
We have got to end the private prison racket in America as quickly as possible.
The top one-tenth of one percent owns about 23 times as much wealth as the bottom 50 percent - over 150 million Americans.
A total of 15 million families were in debt in 2013 with an average indebtedness of $32000.
The average wealth of the top 10 percent was $4 million in 2013 but families in the bottom 25 percent were $13000 in debt on average.
As of 2013 the top 10% of families owned three-quarters of total family wealth in the US. That is unacceptable and has got to change.

The United States has about 5% of the world’s population yet about 22% of its known prisoner population. We need radical reform.
We are seeing a multi-pronged attack on democracy. Anybody who is suppressing the vote is a political coward. 
Our criminal justice system is out of control. The number of African-Americans and Hispanics who are in jails is disproportionately high.
A job must lift workers out of poverty not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage.
It’s time to end the morally repugnant private prison racket and along with it the era of mass incarceration.
The Fed bailed out Wall Street with extremely low interest rates. I think we can stand to treat can treat college graduates the same.
Fracking is not the answer. Fracking contributes to the climate crisis increases earthquake risks and poisons our water.
Older workers shouldn't worry about how they’re going to get by. Our job is to expand Social Security so everyone can retire with dignity.
Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who are saying they do not want cuts to Social Security. They want to expand it.

Cutting Social Security a life and death issue for seniors and those with disabilities isn't just bad economics - it's immoral.

@4TaxFairness: Maker of $84000 drug avoided $10 billion in U.S. taxes report says  #GougerDodger
Gilead bought a taxpayer funded medication and jacked up the price to $1000 per pill or $84000 per treatment. That's outrageous.
Our job in Congress is to ensure a future that is sustainable -- for our environment for our economy for our people and their children.
The pharmaceutical industry has become a major health hazard to the American people. 
"We could fully fund tuition-free public colleges if corporations paid in taxes today what they paid under ""radical socialist"" Ronald Reagan."
In 30 years state and local spending on corrections has increased three times as fast as spending on schools. That is just unacceptable.
If it's radical to think that the United States shouldn't have more people in jail than any other country then yes count me as a radical.
We know we have a problem when spending to incarcerate people rises faster than spending to educate them.
I don’t know how many times I have to say it but I’ll keep saying it until it happens: all people should have a right to health care.
It is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor to stand with working people and when necessary take on the powerful.
It can seem easy to turn our backs on the vulnerable but I believe what human life is about is we everyone has an impact on everyone else.
I wish I could say that we as a country have made enough progress for all Americans to truly be equal by now. But no our fight must go on.
No one will be successful in dividing us. America becomes a greater nation a stronger nation when we stand together as one people.
62 people own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population — around 3.6 billion people. 62 people!
Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2016. That's a disgrace.
Citizens United is nothing less than legalized bribery – plain and simple.
The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the whole of the bottom 99 percent. How do we accept that?
How insane is it for us to literally discourage bright young people from attending college because of how much money their parents make?
While we attack grotesque levels of income inequality in this country we must simultaneously address the structural racism so many endure.
In a thousand different ways we are taught to think small. We are taught to think we can’t change the status quo. That does not have to be.
We should not be passing trade agreements that are opposed by practically every union representing millions of American workers.
Five years ago a $15 minimum wage was considered too radical. But when people see the justice of an idea it catches fire very quickly.
The attack on police officers in Dallas last night is horrifying and despicable. We must as a nation stand against violence of all kinds.
If there is a police related shooting that should trigger an immediate investigation with the Department of Justice.

The New York Times agrees: The Stabenow-Roberts bill is deeply flawed and should not pass. 
Your constitutional rights don’t depend on your race gender religion sexuality or income. I can’t believe we still need to say that.
The struggle for our rights is not the struggle of a day or a year. It is a struggle that must be fought by every generation.
We have to summon up the courage to acknowledge that we are in a crisis situation and that bold action is needed to save our planet.

92% of consumers think GMOs should be labeled. Congress should represent this enormous majority not just wealthy corporations.
The Stabenow-Roberts GMO bill is confusing misleading and unenforceable. It does nothing to make sure consumers know what they’re eating.
Companies all over the country are already labeling GMOs and guess what the sky didn't fall. 
If 64 countries already require labeling of GMOs is it really such a radical idea? 
Sen. Sanders speaking about the Senate GMO labeling bill now. Watch here: 
Agribusiness spent $52 million in campaign contributions this election cycle. It’s not a mystery why Congress won’t support GMO labeling.
Real family values are paid sick time paid family leave and guaranteed vacation time so parents can spend leisure time with their children.
Mars the Grocery Manufacturers Association and North American Meat Institute support the anti-GMO bill. Consumers aren't the priority here.
People have a right to know what's in the food they eat and feed their children. Congress must protect that right.
This is intentionally confusing to consumers and the information may be entirely inaccessible for many consumers. 
The trade agreements pushed by corporate America are great if you are CEO of a major corporation but are a disaster for American workers.
64 other countries around the world require the mandatory labeling of GMO foods. The current Senate bill would not.
The views of the billionaire class are profoundly out of step with working Americans which goes a long way to explain Congress' agenda.
Happy 4th of July! 
Whose views should we trust on trade legislation? Corporate America or organizations that represent working families and the environment?
It's interesting that Republicans who tell us how terrible the government is now want to overturn GMO labeling laws passed in 4 states.
Understanding the magnitude of the climate crisis means realizing that good environmental policy is also good economic policy.
“Who are to be the electors of the Federal Representatives? Not the rich more than the poor.” -James Madison
Let us never forget that in 2008 Wall Street’s greed recklessness and illegal behavior nearly destroyed our economy.

The anti-GMO bill is confusing and toothless. It will do nothing to help with food transparency and harm the already work done by states.
Big Ag spent hundreds of millions on lobbying and campaign contributions to stop GMO labeling laws. We can’t let them get away with it.
Food companies believe they have a right to unlimited profits but they don't think people have a right to know what's in the food they eat.
The anti-GMO bill in the Senate is confusing misleading and unenforceable. We must have higher standards than that for federal legislation.
The Stabenow-Roberts anti-GMO bill contains huge loopholes in the labeling requirement. There’s not even a penalty for violating it.
The poor will see politics as irrelevant and won't join the political process as long as both parties continue to ignore their problems.
Monsanto's goal is to deny states the right to label GMOs. If we don't stop them they may just succeed. Watch: 
Change happens in this country when people come together to say the status quo is unacceptable. I believe we are in such a moment right now.
I am proud that Vermont is first state to mandate GMO labeling. What I’m not proud of is the Senate bill trying to destroy this progress.
@Salon: Bernie blasts Puerto Rico bill and Wall Street vulture funds in powerful Senate speech  
@AlexApple_: First look: What does @SenSanders think of a federal GMO compromise that would affect Vermont's law? WATCH:
Sen. Roberts' GMO bill imposes no penalties whatsoever for violating the labeling requirement making the law essentially meaningless.
The GMO legislation in Congress would create a confusing misleading and unenforceable national standard for labeling GMOs. It cannot pass.

Big agriculture companies like Monsanto do not believe people have a right to know what's in the food they eat.
NEWS: Sanders Vows to Defend Vermont’s GMO Labeling Law 
Vermont has shown what happens when democracy works. The people speak state government responds and important legislation gets passed.
I'm proud of the grassroots activism that led to this law and the support the legislature and @GovPeterShumlin gave. 
It's not complicated. People want to know the quality of the food they're eating and what they're giving to their kids. #JustLabelIt
I Will Do Everything I Can to Defeat This Terrible GMO Bill. A letter from Sen. Sanders: 
All over Europe we've got dozens and dozens of countries which label GMO products. We should be able to do that here in America as well.
If we don't act our grandchildren will wonder what was so important about fossil fuel profits that it was worth sacrificing their future.

Congress’ job is to represent what the people want and an enormous majority of Americans want genetically modified food to be labeled.
It's long past time we opened the military to openly transgender people. Glad to see this step toward equality. 
My entire political career has been dedicated to the conviction that Americans are entitled to live lives of decency and dignity.
Proud @AtBennington will take part in Second Chance Pell. Rehabilitation not more incarceration will help inmates get back on their feet.
"It really is frightening when you have a party that controls both the House and Senate that says ""You know what? We reject science."""
We can live in a country where every person who dreams of becoming a citizen has a rational path forward not just a dark corner to hide in.
@politico: Sanders steps up battle against GMO bill  
We need fair trade not “free trade.” Americans should not have to compete against workers in low-wage countries who earn pennies an hour.
I'll do everything I can to defeat this pathetic GMO labeling bill. It is not only misleading it's toothless. The fight is not over.
The overwhelming majority of Americans agree: GMOs should be labeled. 
We have an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change.
Another reason why this bill must be defeated. 
Decisions made regarding the future of Puerto Rico must be made by the people of Puerto Rico. America must not become a colonial master.
It would be a colossal tragedy if the next generation had a lower standard of living than their parents but that is where we're headed.
Morally should we allow Wall Street to make huge profits while nutrition programs for Puerto Rican kids are cut?
The time has come to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the people of Puerto Rico as American citizens.
Billionaires can't receive a 100% return on investments while Puerto Rican children go hungry. Puerto Rico can't be hijacked by Wall Street.
At a time when the people of Puerto Rico are suffering PROMESA would make a terrible situation even worse.
It's not a radical idea to tell people what's in the food they're eating. 64 countries label GMOs. Why can't the US? 
Incredibly the wealthiest 62 people on the planet now own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population - 3.7 billion people.
People have a right to know what’s in their food. Vermont has taken the lead on GMO labeling—now we need it everywhere.
This bill requires Puerto Ricans to pay for the undemocratic control board at an unbelievable sum of $370 million. That's absurd.
From a moral perspective should we pass legislation that rewards billionaires while allowing schools to be closed and pensions to be cut?
The Republicans' solution to the Puerto Rico debt crisis is colonialism at its worst.
Headed to the Senate floor now to speak about the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico. Watch here: 
It’s 2016 and yet some lawmakers still want to regulate women’s bodies. I find this just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.
NEWS: Sanders To Put Hold on GMO Labeling Legislation 
I will do everything I can to defeat this weak GMO labeling bill in the Senate beginning by putting a hold on it.
Monsanto promised dairy farmers that GMO corn would reduce the amount of chemicals they used. Instead it's doubled. 
Our grandchildren will ask us why we allowed fossil fuel companies to rake in record profits while climate change ravages our planet.
Glad the Court protected the voice of working people today. When unions are strong the middle class is strong. 
We are not going back to the days when women did not have full access to birth control.
Glad to see the Court agrees women should have access to their full array of health care options. 
The skyrocketing cost of college today is not just a loss for many bright young people and their families; it is a loss to our country.
Let's face it: until we put patients over profits our health care system will not work for ordinary Americans.
The test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in but how we can use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way.
We must listen to the scientific community not Fox News and lead the world in reversing climate change. 
After all the progress we've made on women’s rights we can't go back to the days when women didn't have the right to control their bodies.
NEWS: Sanders Applauds Supreme Court Ruling on Abortion  
The value of the minimum wage is 25% lower than it was in 1968. It’s not a radical idea to try to keep up with costs of living.
The Supreme Court today reaffirmed that access to abortion is a woman’s constitutional right. It cannot be blocked by extreme Republicans.
We want an economy that is not based on uncontrollable greed monopolistic practices and illegal behavior.
For too many Americans the dream of progress and opportunity is denied by an economy that funnels virtually all of the wealth to the top.
When people stand together when people are prepared to fight back there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.
As a kid I learned everyday in my house what lack of money means to a family. That's a lesson I have never forgotten and never will forget.
We want the best educated population on earth not the most incarcerated population.
Too many people are serving unnecessarily long mandatory minimum sentences.
Millions of Americans have police records as a result of marijuana possession which should be decriminalized.
We need universal voter registration so that anyone 18 years of age or older who is eligible to vote is automatically registered.
If you are a male worker in the middle of the economy you are making $700 less than you made 43 years ago. That's wrong.
We have one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country yet Republican governors are working overtime to suppress the vote.
As Lincoln put it at Gettysburg we want a government of the people by the people and for the people.
Free tuition is not inconceivable. In fact it used to be the case at great public universities and colleges all across the United States.
The wealthy and multinational corporations who are doing phenomenally well should do their part to help the middle class rebuild.
Are we comfortable as a nation to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever?
Our criminal justice system is broken. We have 2.2 million people rotting behind bars at an annual expense of $80 billion.
We need a tax on carbon an end to fracking and massive investment in renewable energy. We want to leave this planet healthy and habitable.
I'm worried about global cooperation breaking down but it's also a sign that people are being left out. #BrexitVote
I've got seven beautiful grandchildren and I will be damned if I leave them a world which is not habitable.
51 million people have no paid sick leave. Not only is this damaging to our economy it’s completely unethical.
America is not about attacking the most vulnerable people in our country. We cannot allow that to happen.
I don't think many lawmakers know that wages have been stagnant for 35 years. They don't see what people are going through.
GMO labeling isn't controversial. It exists in dozens of countries. People have a right to know what is in the food they eat.
I am going to do everything I can to defeat this GMO labeling legislation which preempts Vermont's law. 
Freedom of speech in my view does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.
Instead of keeping more people in jail than any other country we should move toward criminal justice reform at federal and local levels.
Our students are better prepared and our nation is stronger when we create a more diverse and inclusive environment.

Middle-income working women are making $1500 less than they did in 2007. That is just plain wrong.
We can expand Social Security benefits and extend the life of the program for 58 years.  
When our military budget rivals every other nation's combined we can afford judicious cuts to our military without compromising our safety.
It is not class warfare to say the extremely wealthy don't need another tax break after their incomes rose immensely in the last 30 years.
It is unacceptable that the average worker pays $760 in taxes each year to make up for corporations hiding profits offshore.
Black women make 60% of what a white man makes. For Hispanic women it's 55%. That is nothing but sexism and discrimination.
Democracy is not about a handful of billionaires spending as much money as they want on any political race in this country.
85% of Americans support keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists. Why don't Republicans?
California is showing we can have an affordable and sustainable energy system without the risks of nuclear power. 
Our job is not to allow politicians divide us up by where our family came from the color of our skin our religion or sexual orientation.
We must fight to make certain that women throughout the country have the right to control their own bodies.
It's not hard to understand: terrorists potential terrorists criminals and the dangerously mentally ill shouldn't have access to guns.
It is incomprehensible to me and I believe to the vast majority of Americans as to why Republicans would oppose commonsense gun safety.
Frankly these Democratic gun safety amendments are no-brainers.

Infrastructure does not get better by itself. We can all agree that if you don't invest in repairs it’s just not going to get better.
This great government of ours should be working for all of us not just the few on top.
The trade union movement taught us influence over one’s working conditions is necessary for workers' influence in politics and economics.
Bankers on Wall Street may be fraudulent but they're not dumb. They spend millions lobbying Congress because they know a good investment.
Members of the LGBTQ community must be guaranteed the same rights and protections as every other American citizen.
It’s about time join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right and not a privilege.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
When government involves itself in making the world we inhabit livable and rebuilding our infrastructure we create millions of good jobs.
The heart of any real campaign finance reform must be a limit on spending - an end to the money chase.
How can politicians talk about morality and family values when we turn our backs on the millions of children and families in poverty?
It won’t be easy but we must be prepared to stand together and take on the billionaire class and their greed.
The Declaration of Independence says that all men are created equal. That includes everyone in the LGBT community no exceptions.
In my view women should not be making 79 cents to the dollar - or less - than men in the United States in 2016.
No one's so naive as to think Wall Street spent $800 million on lobbying and campaign donations in 2014 because they like giving away money.
By not making college more affordable and accessible we are saying to families that we do not want their kids to get a college education.
Instead of talking about punishment and vengeance let us have the courage to talk about how we get to the root causes of crime.
In my view the time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off of the federal government’s list of outlawed drugs.
With obesity mental health issues and chronic diseases all on the rise we must act on the need for accessible health care for all.
Low income families should not be forced to choose between heating and eating.
Reminding ordinary people that government can work for them and can speak with their voice is I believe the hope for America's future.
We need to come together to prevent hatred and create the kind of nation based on love that we all know we can become.
One hateful person committed the atrocity in Orlando not an entire people or an entire religion. 
To Republicans I say step up join the vast majority of Americans. Stop guns from falling into the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
We owe a debt of gratitude to @ChrisMurphyCT for demanding action to help prevent gun violence. Congress has been silent for too long.
The weapon used in Orlando was legally purchased after a background check. Assault weapons like it should be outright banned.
If there is any silver lining to the terrible tragedy in Orlando it is for us to bring people together to prevent violence of all kinds.
Citizens United was the one of most disastrous Supreme Court decisions in history and it must be overturned.
What sense does it make for people to be able to purchase military-style weapons designed to kill people? #Enough
I stand with @ChrisMurphyCT to demand common sense gun safety. We can't allow guns to fall into the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
The high level of student loan debt is causing irreparable harm to families across the United States and the economy as a whole.
Our job is to take pride in our diversity to bring our people together and to not let hatred to divide us up.
We must not allow politicians to divide us by where our family came from by the color of our skin our religion or sexual orientation.
It doesn't make sense for someone to be able to walk into a store and purchase a military style weapon that has one purpose: to kill people.
Before we cut Social Security and Medicare we might want to pass legislation to make the wealthy start paying their fair share in taxes.
The fight for justice is not a concept we hear a lot about in politics anymore. Justice - that is what we should be fighting for.
The kind of stresses and pressures that a lack of money puts on a family is something that I learned as a kid and which has stuck with me.
Today's decision will help ensure we don't turn over our democracy to the highest bidder. 
To blame an entire religion for the acts of a single individual is bigotry pure and simple. It is not what this country is about.
This is the greatest nation on earth. We are far too experienced and wise to get caught up in constant partisan conflict.
"@ReneeWPTZ: @SenSanders speaks in #btv ""One hateful person committed this crime-not an entire people or an entire religion."" "
We are the custodians of this planet. We must take action to address climate change. There is nowhere else to go.
We have got to do everything that we can to make sure guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them.
People working full time should not be living in poverty. It’s time to raise the minimum wage everywhere.
It's imperative that progressives maintain a vision a vision that seeks social justice and cries out for this nation's true potential.
Reminding ordinary people that government can work for them and can speak with their voice is I believe the hope for America's future.
It’s baffling that even with overwhelming scientific consensus leaders of this country still deny the existence of climate change.
The question of our time is whether we will take on the enormous power of the billionaire class or do we slide into political oligarchy.
Huge profitable corporations regularly get massive government subsidies. We have socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor.
What seems radical today will seem mainstream tomorrow if we stand together.
Strong unions are the reason why America once led the world in wages in benefits. We must rebuild the trade union movement in this country.
We must invest in the young people today because they are our nation’s future doctors teachers engineers scientists and senators.
The best function for banks is to reinvest in America so that we can build affordable housing factories and small businesses.
Instead of funding more jails and more incarceration maybe - just maybe - we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.
Let us demand that every man woman and child in this country have a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living.
Maybe we should have members of Congress wear NASCAR jackets which tell us who is sponsoring them.
Men and women have not put their lives on the line to defend our democracy for a handful of wealthy people to buy candidates and elections.
Millionaires and billionaires who control super PACs have more money and influence over campaigns than the candidates themselves.
If we want to get tough on crime let us deal with the causes of crime instead of using taxpayer money to incarcerate millions of people.
To restore our one person one vote democracy we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. 78% of Americans agree.
The solution to Puerto Rico’s debt crisis is not more austerity.  The solution is more economic development.
We should want more people voting not less. If we believe that then it's high time we established automatic voter registration nationally.
Frankly much of our economic and trade policy is a disgrace designed to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the average worker.
The current political campaign finance system is corrupt and amounts to legalized bribery.
The most revolting part of the student loan crisis is that the federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year.
How can the United States stand to be the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right?
"Progress takes place when young people pick up the torch and say ""This is a world we are going to change."" "
I think democracy should be about elected officials talking and communicating with people regardless of their income.
Too many Americans in this country have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use.
Our nation has always been a refuge for the oppressed. We must unite families not tear them apart. The deportation raids must end.
People spend millions on campaigns because they have an agenda. And the billionaire agenda is not the agenda of the American people.
My advice for climate change deniers in Congress: Worry less about you campaign contributions and more about your children.
It’s absurd that we have more people in jail than any other nation including China a Communist authoritarian country four times our size.
We live in the richest nation in the history of the world but we can’t even provide the most elementary human needs to millions of people.

Something is wrong in America when one family the Walton family of Walmart owns as much wealth as the bottom 42% of Americans combined.
In the US we have 2.2 million people in jail today more than any other country. We need major changes in our criminal justice system.
We must stop letting multinational fossil fuels corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense. 
While the middle class is disappearing the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally and corporations are making at record-breaking profits.
No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to our nation’s economic well-being.
We cannot fix our criminal justice system if corporations are allowed to profit from mass incarceration.
Tragically in America today we have more people in jail than any other country in the world.
A black male baby born today if we do not change the system stands a one-in-three chance of ending up in jail. That is unacceptable.
The U.S. must join the nations that understand the benefits of having an educated workforce that isn’t burdened with enormous student debt.
The bottom line is the vast majority of climate scientists agree that our planet is warming and that human activities are the primary cause.
Members of Congress can no longer allow the drug companies to charge our people the highest rates in the world. We have to make a stand.
It's my firm belief that all students regardless of background should receive the education they need and the education they deserve.
Life would be a lot different for a poor person in Vermont if they had health care as a right which is the case 50 miles north in Canada.
If the Walton family can receive billions in taxpayer subsidies maybe it's OK for working people to get health care and paid family leave.
The solution to Puerto Rico’s debt crisis is not more austerity. The solution is more economic development more jobs and less poverty.
The Democratic Party must stand on the side of working people and low-income people not Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry.
Privatizing the VA would be a huge mistake and a great disservice to the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.
The U.S. can lead the world in reversing climate change by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy.
Despite Americans being some of the most productive workers in the world wages haven't kept up with inflation since 1968. This must change.
What poverty in America is tragically about is that we have millions of people who are dying at ages much much younger than they should.
If it's radical to think that the United States shouldn't have more people in jail than any other country then yes count me as a radical.
