With Syria‚Äôs announcement earlier this week the United States became the only country on the wrong side of history. 
It‚Äôs been more than a month since CHIP expired. Republicans in Congress still have not acted.
#TeamKamala is on Snapchat! Get the latest updates: 
Even after Tuesday‚Äôs victories we cannot become complacent. 2018 is right around the corner and we need everyone to get involved to help win back the House and Senate.
Sexual harassment and assault are real in this country from movie sets to newsrooms to factory floors. And we need to confront it.
The GOP tax bill would add $1.7 trillion (yes trillion) to the national debt over the next ten years to lower taxes for wealthy Americans. 
This past weekend some of my colleagues and I examined recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. What‚Äôs happening there continues to be a humanitarian crisis ‚Äî approximately 58% of Puerto Rico is still without electricity. 
Just another way the GOP tax bill would hurt Californians. We cannot allow it to become law. 
California is home to 220000 DACA recipients. I stand for them and I stand with them. They are #HereToStay. #DreamActNow
We know affordable education sets our children up for success and we cannot let the next generation graduate with immoral amounts of debt. That‚Äôs why I support pathways to free tuition at public colleges and universities.
Despite the forces of hate and division that are trying to tear us apart Americans have so much more in common than what separates us.
Donate now to support Doug Jones ‚Äî a candidate with integrity running for Senate in Alabama.
Approximately 800000 Dreamers know no other home than the United States. We must bring the Dream Act up for a vote. #DreamActNow
Dreamers: I hear you I see you I‚Äôm with you. We need the #DreamActNow.
Weapons of war don‚Äôt belong on our streets. 
In this past year we have demonstrated that we can and will combat these difficult times together. Let‚Äôs keep fighting.
We won‚Äôt throw up our hands when it is time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are. We won‚Äôt retreat. We will continue to fight for our ideals.

Today on the 40th anniversary of Harvey Milk‚Äôs historic election as California‚Äôs first openly gay official we must remember his words ‚ÄúHope will never be silent.‚Äù
The historic wins across the country last night for women members of the LGBTQ community people of color and Americans of every faith showed our diversity is our strength.
@RepJenniffer: The people of PR have experienced so much devastation it's our job to be here see them hear them and fight for them @K‚Ä¶
A year ago today I asked the question ‚Äúdo we retreat or do we fight?‚Äù From marches to stopping the Affordable Care Act repeal we did not retreat.
November 8 2016. As the results started to roll in my team and I knew it was going to be a long night ‚Üí 
There are so many incredible stories to share ‚Äî too many to count them all. But know this: Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power. Let‚Äôs remember that today. We must recommit ourselves to the important fights that lay ahead.
Chris Hurst a former television anchor whose girlfriend was killed in a shooting that occurred on-air won an election for state house in Virginia ‚Äî running on the idea that we need commonsense gun reforms now. 
Manka Dhingra a first-time candidate who became active in politics after Trump's win last year won a special election to help Democrats take control of the Washington State Senate. 
In Helena Montana voters elected Wilmot Collins a former refugee from Liberia to become the state's first-ever Black mayor. 
"Vi Lyles became the first Black female mayor of Charlotte NC after running a campaign focused on building a ""city of opportunity and inclusiveness‚Äù where ‚Äúa woman whose father didn‚Äôt graduate from high school can become this city‚Äôs first female African-American mayor.‚Äù "
"As Danica said last night: ""No matter what you look like where you come from how you worship who you love how you identify or any other inherent identifier that you have you should be celebrated because of who you are not despite it."""
Justin Fairfax became the second Black Virginian elected statewide. Kathy Tran a refugee from Vietnam became the first Asian American woman elected to the VA state house. Danica Roem became the first openly transgender elected official in state history. 
Democrats embraced our diversity and our unity in yesterday's elections and the results speak for themselves. Here are a few examples:
Congratulations to my former colleague @MarkHerringVA and to @FairfaxJustin on his historic win tonight! Virginia is in good hands.
.@pwcdanica stood up to intolerance ‚Äî and won. Congratulations on your historic victory tonight.
Congratulations to @RalphNortham and his team for showing that Virginia won‚Äôt stand for hatred and bigotry.

ACA open enrollment period has begun &amp; we‚Äôre already seeing record numbers! Go to  to pick the right plan for you. 
Bots are being used to disrupt our democracy. @Twitter must address this issue seriously heading into 2018. 
The most important thing you can do today is vote. Your voice matters. Don‚Äôt have any regrets on Wednesday ‚Üí 
90 Americans are killed on average every day by guns. We must honestly acknowledge the epidemic of gun violence &amp; work together to curb it
The Trump Admin is proposing to cut the @NatlParkService budget by almost $300M while almost tripling entrance fees
Trump is abandoning America's place as a world leader ‚Äî this time on climate change and health care. 
@TheRoot: Sen. @KamalaHarris‚Äã reminds us that there's nothing more important than the truth: 
Tomorrow is Election Day. Voting for city council matters. Voting for mayor matters. Voting for governor matters. Make your voice heard.
The tragedy that happened in TX has become too routine in America. As we pray for those recovering we also must commit ourselves to action.
@ErickFernandez: Whoa this statement from @ChrisMurphyCT on the Sutherland Springs Texas shooting is extremely powerful. Wow. 
We‚Äôve lost far too many of our classmates friends family members &amp; children to gun violence. Another moment of silence alone won‚Äôt suffice
Senseless gun violence has torn apart another community ‚Äî this time in a house of worship. When do we say enough is enough? 
"It‚Äôs ‚è∞ for this country to ask: ""Who are we?‚Äù We have 2 days until Election Day VA. I believe you will be a part of that answer. "
As the poet Audre Lorde reminds us ‚Äúthere are so many silences to be broken.‚Äù So speak out. Be loud. Even when others are silent.
In 2017 the ability to breathe clean air and live in a healthy environment should not be a partisan issue. 
The scientific evidence is clear ‚Äî humans are contributing to climate change despite what officials in this Administration say. 
Help us spread the word about open enrollment! You have until Dec. 15 to sign up unless your state extended (CA has until Jan. 31).
Add your name if you believe Secretary DeVos should stand with students over predatory for-profit colleges:

Taking money away from essential health funds to pay for children‚Äôs health insurance is just wrong. 
Americans won‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî we know some of the biggest winners of this plan are corporations and the wealthy. 
Jeff Sessions needs to come back to the Senate and testify under oath again. We deserve the truth.  
We have got to stop playing politics with Dreamers‚Äô lives.

#FlashbackFriday to the @HRC dinner where I had the opportunity to meet the incredible tennis player &amp; advocate @BillieJeanKing. 
Our country has a responsibility to make education attainable without digging students into a financial hole. This shouldn‚Äôt be partisan.
Republicans in Congress still haven‚Äôt renewed CHIP funding &amp; some states are starting to run out of $$$. The clock is ticking. Time to act.
No one should have to hide not in the closet or in the shadows. Remember our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.
Repealing the estate tax is a giveaway to those at the top ‚Äî not something that will create jobs. We have to oppose this plan.
The gender pay gap is greatest for Latinas. They make on average only 54 cents for every $1 a white man makes. #LatinaEqualPay

Tech companies need teams solely dedicated to countering state-sponsored information operations.
This Admin is waging an assault on our deepest values and targeting vulnerable‚Äîand often voiceless‚Äîcommunities. Speak up register to vote.
Virginia in six days you can show our country that division and hatred do not reflect the ideals of who we are. 
It‚Äôs critical that the Census fairly and accurately counts all Americans in an impartial manner free from undue interference.
Women no matter their immigration status should be able to make their own choices about their health. Period. 
These tourists came to New York City to celebrate what should have been a joyous occasion. This is heartbreaking. 
Let‚Äôs go @Dodgers! One more game. Let‚Äôs bring that trophy home to the Golden State. #ThisTeam
Earlier at the #TechHearings I asked Facebook Google and Twitter how much they‚Äôve profited from Russia propaganda. No one had an answer.

We must speak the truth. Even when it makes people uncomfortable. Even when others are silent. 
It‚Äôs been almost a full month since CHIP funding expired leaving 1.3 million California children at risk. 
Tell your friends and family in Virginia: getting out the vote is more important than ever. Find events here: 
From the United States Congress to the United States Census LGBT rights are under attack. We must stand on the side of equality.
Transgender troops are willing to defend our country. Turning them away is un-American. 
California will recover and I‚Äôm working to ensure those affected can get the resources they need to rebuild. 
@MarkHerringVA: Proud to have the support of my good friend and former California AG Senator @KamalaHarris! 
Fighting for everyone‚Äôs civil rights is in our common interest. No one should have to fight alone.
Every day that we fail to do right by DACA recipients is a day our country is failing an important moral test. 
This is unacceptable. We can‚Äôt become silent about gun violence just weeks after the deadly Vegas shooting. 
#GOPBudget would cut $ from Medicaid for opioid treatment. Let's help victims heal‚Äìnot cut their resources 
Steep increases in fees at national parks would discourage many Americans from visiting. Submit a comment &amp; say NO: 
CA is experiencing the worst fires in history and they are becoming more frequent. They must be a priority. 
It is clear that the cause of justice and equality has never been more urgent. We must stay engaged stay active and stay loud.
This country needs more than a declaration; we need more funding to combat the opioid epidemic that's threatening millions.
We made a promise to young #DACA recipients. People must stop playing politics with their lives.
Around 700 women die every year from pregnancy or delivery complications. We must do better as a nation to get them the care they need. 
This legislation is a direct attack on women‚Äôs reproductive and economic freedom. 
This is troubling. Americans deserve ‚Äãanswers into how ‚Äãthis happened.
A fee increase will hurt working families who want to enjoy our nation's natural beauty and public lands.
Just a reminder that funding for CHIP which provides care for 9 million children still hasn‚Äôt been renewed. It‚Äôs been 27 days.
Leadership starts at every age. #FlashbackFriday 
California has the largest number of DACA recipients. Let‚Äôs do the right thing and protect them. #DACA
Shackling pregnant women some even while they give birth is dangerous and downright cruel. 
Creating media conglomerates that amplify a few wealthy voices is not in America's best interests. 
California is leading the way and preparing for increasing wildfires but the federal government must do its part. 
Tell Congress that you agree: No spending bill without a DACA fix ‚Üí 
"@splinter_news: ""This is something we cannot play politics with.""Sen. @KamalaHarris is opposing the end-of-year spending bill unless‚Ä¶"

@broadcity I see you üëÄ
CA's fire season hasn‚Äôt ended yet but it‚Äôs already burned more acres than the average for the past 5 yrs. We must address climate change.
I subscribe to the notion that the American dream belongs to all of us not just the wealthy or powerful.
Entire communities in CA were devastated by the wildfires. If you or anyone you know needs assistance please go to  
Let me be clear: I will oppose the end-of-year spending bill unless it fixes DACA.
Natural disasters‚Äîfrom fires to hurricanes to floods‚Äîdo not discriminate by region or by party. We must help each other when these hit.
Yesterday the GOP denied consumers rights and protections from big banks and predatory lenders. Wall Street was chosen over Main Street. 
Donny Riveras a young man in Santa Rosa risked his own life to save his neighbors before the fires spread to their neighborhood. 
From health care to climate change I want to hear from you about the important issues facing our country ‚Üí 
Don‚Äôt take this heat lightly. There is a chance of elevated fire danger ‚Äî please stay alert. 
It‚Äôs been 24 days and the Republican-controlled Congress has yet to renew CHIP. We must act quickly. 
If you were affected by the recent wildfires and need relief assistance please visit 
The GOP is trying to pass through their budget with a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid &amp; Medicare. Simply put Americans deserve better.
Dreamers are valuable to our economic future. Congress must act now. 
This Administration‚Äôs campaign against students with disabilities continues. We should be doing more not less to help them. 
CHIP provides kids with:‚ÜíRoutine check-ups‚ÜíImmunizations‚ÜíDental careNot reauthorizing this program leaves up to 9M children vulnerable.
A domestic violence organization launched a program in California to help train survivors to become entrepreneurs. 
A budget is a reflection of our values and should invest in our middle class. Our country deserves it.
Opioid abuse will not end when pharmaceutical companies flood our communities with drugs. 
Under the GOP budget they give tax cuts to the top 1% while leaving the federal government unable to pay $1.5 trillion worth of bills.
Earlier this week I pressed the OPM nominee on what he‚Äôll do to protect LGBTQ federal workers from discrimination in the workplace. 
The GOP budget will:‚úÇÔ∏èCut $500 billion from Medicare‚úÇÔ∏èCut $1 trillion from Medicaid üìàIncrease the deficit by $1.5 trillion

ICYMI: Sen. @DianneFeinstein and I are calling for improvements to the emergency alert systems. 
More than 4600 Californians die each year from opioid overdoses. We need to treat this epidemic like the public health crisis it is.
Thank you for all the wonderful birthday wishes! I really appreciated all the tweets calls and messages.
The number of uninsured Americans rose by over 12% for the first time since 2014. We must ensure health care is a right not a privilege. 
The budget passed by the Senate GOP cuts Medicaid &amp; Medicare by $1.5 trillion &amp; will drive up our nation‚Äôs deficit. Americans deserve better
My Democratic colleagues and I are calling on the DHS to ensure that every single storm-related death is being counted correctly.

Just a reminder that Trump‚Äôs border wall is a waste of money. 
Love you @douglasemhoff! 
The budget that passed the Senate yesterday hurts our nation‚Äôs most vulnerable ‚Äî which is why I voted against it. 
Congratulations to the @Dodgers on their win against the @Cubs last night. On to the World Series!

Four weeks after Hurricane Maria:‚ÜíOnly 19% of Puerto Rico has power‚Üí70% have clean drinking waterWe can't forget about them.

To all LGBTQ youth who face bullying and harassment because of their identities: We have your back today and every day. #SpiritDay
Muslim Ban 3.0 was driven by campaign rhetoric &amp; hate not national security. I joined my colleagues on a bill to block its implementation.
This Domestic Violence Awareness Month we can‚Äôt ignore the connection between domestic abuse and gun violence. 
It‚Äôs time for Congress to come together and do right by the most vulnerable among us: our country‚Äôs kids. 
Money bail overtly affects low-income communities and communities of color. 9 out of 10 defendants detained cannot afford to post bail.

Right now in CA it‚Äôs about recovery and still fighting fires. We‚Äôre with those affected every step of the way. 
A reminder that open enrollment begins on November 1. Despite Trump‚Äôs actions and words enrollment will still go on
As we learn more names &amp; more stories I want to give my condolences to all the victims of the California wildfires.
.@RepCarbajal and I introduced bicameral legislation to designate nearly 250000 acres of public land as wilderness for future generations.
Great to join @PeterHamby for @Snapchat‚Äôs Good Luck America story. Check it out now:  
Trump‚Äôs heartless actions will have a dramatic ramifications for Americans who need health care. 
While Trump disregards the people of Puerto Rico we must remember what‚Äôs happening is a humanitarian crisis and it‚Äôs up to us to help them. 
To everyone who has come forward with #MeToo thank you for your courage. To all survivors know that you are not alone.
This weekend @JerryBrownGov @DianneFeinstein and I surveyed wildfire damage and met with residents. üì∑: @JerryBrownGov 
Dreamers are in a state of limbo right now. We must be compassionate ‚Äî pass a clean Dream Act and work on comprehensive immigration reform. 
Don‚Äôt forget that Congress has still not renewed the funding for CHIP which provides care for millions of our kids.
Thank you to all the first responders and medical professionals who are running on little sleep and continuously saving lives.
Throughout every natural disaster we have seen Americans rise up to help our neighbors. Now's the time to lift up CA 
This Administration‚Äôs disturbing targeting of immigrant communities has led to a discouraging decline in domestic violence reports. 
This Administration is deliberately ignoring the global threat of climate change and favoring polluters over Americans‚Äô health.
These are American citizens. We must treat them that way and do all we can to help.
Be sure to follow @Cal_OES and @CAL_FIRE if you‚Äôre not already for critical wildfire updates. Please heed any evacuation orders.
Numerous Californians are hurting right now from the wildfires. Please consider chipping in to help them out: 
Trump‚Äôs decision earlier this week endangers health care for our friends family and neighbors. 
There are a number of ways to assist the victims of the fires wreaking havoc in California: 
Please be sure to keep all the medical professionals who are saving lives in California in your thoughts. 
As the #Californiawildfires continue please consider donating to those who have been displaced or hurt: 
From cutting the open enrollment period to the latest exec. order this Admin is actively undermining health care for millions of Americans. 
Americans deserve a budget that creates opportunities for affordable education and provides for safer communities.
.@MarshallMovie is an amazing tribute to a man who changed the course of American history for the better through the power of the courts.
Winds are expected to increase again tonight. Make sure you are prepared for wildfires: 
Happy birthday to my wonderful husband @douglasemhoff! Can't wait to celebrate your special day with you. 
Your help will make a real difference in the lives of so many Californians affected by devastating wildfires: 
Thank you to California‚Äôs firefighters who are out there often for more than 24 hrs straight battling these blazes
This is cruel and vindictive. This decision could cause premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans.
This DACA fight is about all the young people who were brought here some before they could walk or talk.
Your boss should not be making health care decisions for you. Period. 
With the arbitrary DACA deadline the Trump Admin tried to set Dreamers up for failure. Let‚Äôs ensure they don‚Äôt fail &amp; pass the #DreamAct.
If you live in an area affected by smoke but are still safe please try to stay in buildings with filtered air.
Praying for the friends and families of the Californians who were killed by these deadly wildfires. 
Reminder: We‚Äôre 12 days into October and Congress has yet to renew CHIP the children‚Äôs health insurance program after funding expired.
This Administration's efforts to sabotage the ACA will harm Californians. Health care isn't a game people's lives are at risk. 
Please chip in whatever you can to support Californians who have been displaced or hurt by the wildfires: 
To tackle the challenges of the 21st century we must empower women and families lifting them up not tearing them down. #DayoftheGirl
For those who want to help the victims of the #CaliforniaWildfires ‚Äî here are 8 things you can do right now: 
On #ComingOutDay no matter who you are or who you love know that you are not alone.
Food banks in Napa County Yuba County and Sonoma County are currently accepting donations. 
The link below includes a list of shelters in California for wildfire evacuees. Please share. 
.@DianneFeinstein and I called on Trump to expedite federal assistance to help areas affected by wildfires rebuild.
As a nation of immigrants we can‚Äôt turn our backs on Dreamers potentially forcing them to leave the only home they‚Äôve ever known.
Roberto Clemente born in Puerto Rico was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. #HispanicHeritageMonth 
The federal minimum wage should be a living wage. $7.25 an hour is not enough to keep a roof over your head.
Rolling back these protections endangers access to clean air. It‚Äôs outrageous. 
Thank you to the first responders and firefighters who are working tirelessly to battle the fires in California.
I believe it is time to replace the divide and conquer of our politics with a new way of thinking: Diversity + Commonality = Unity.
Please heed evacuation orders for wildfires. Follow @Cal_OES &amp; @CAL_FIRE for safety info. Stay safe out there. 
Immigrants helped build this country. They are servicemembers business leaders Nobel winners teachers and neighbors.
Today we cannot forget the indigenous people who were here before us. 
I strongly support @DianneFeinstein's reelection campaign and am thankful she is again offering to serve our state. 
Passing a clean DREAM Act needs to be our immediate priority. These principles are a non-starter. 
Dreamers are Americans in every way. We are doing them a disservice by not passing the Dream Act. 
The GOP budget would slash Pell Grant funding which makes college more affordable for more than 8 million students by more than $100B.
Keep fighting every single day to defend and expand on the progress made for women‚Äôs rights and reproductive health. We can‚Äôt fall backward.
The American flag you see waving over the United States Capitol is about fighting for what we can be as a nation.
To everyone fighting for our Dreamers: Walk with your chin up and shoulders back. You are fighting for the future of this country.
Congress needs to stop playing politics with our health care and going out of their way to target women in the process.
DACA recipients would contribute $460B in the national GDP over the next decade. Creating a path to citizenship makes our economy stronger.
Establishing a national memorial would ensure we never forget the lives lost during the St. Francis Dam disaster.
We don‚Äôt need weapons of war on our streets. 
It‚Äôs true for all things ‚Äî when we move forward as a community when we advance as a family we become an overwhelming force.
Fighting for our Dreamers is about patriotism and ultimately ensuring we live up to the ideals of our country each &amp; every day. #HereToStay 
The GOP budget cuts Medicare by $473B and Medicaid by $1 trillion all in order to reduce taxes for the top 1%. It‚Äôs shameful.
Bump stocks increase the fire rate for a semi-automatic weapon ‚Äî up to 800 rounds/min. Tell Congress to ban them: 
Americans deserve a budget that strengthens the middle class and opens up more opportunities for working people to succeed.
California lost many precious lives on Sunday. We must never forget their names and their stories. 
This administration just rolled back birth control coverage for American women. In 2017. 
All of us in public service have a duty to give voice to the vulnerable give voice to the voiceless and give dignity in the process.
We made a promise to Dreamers that we would not deport them. We must pass the Dream Act. üìπ: @MoveOn 
Just like our friends in Texas or Florida Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands deserves to be a priority.
Tell Congress to fund CHIP before millions of kids lose their health care ‚Üí
The GOP‚Äôs tax plan opens the door to Medicaid and Medicare cuts. We can‚Äôt let them get away with this. 
A government has three functions: public health public safety and public education. The GOP budget doesn‚Äôt prioritize any of them.
I‚Äôm joining with @SenFeinstein on legislation that would ban gun bump stocks. It is just common sense. 
Very good news this #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth: Improvements in screening and early detection has led to a drop in breast cancer deaths. 
Americans are being hurt by this Administration's efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. It‚Äôs indefensible. 
Jonathan Smith risked his life in Las Vegas so others could get out safely. 
No American citizen should be left clamoring for help after a devastating hurricane.

9M children need us to speak up for them. That‚Äôs why I will be sharing how many kids in each state plus D.C are at risk without CHIP:
DACA recipients were never notified directly of the changes in rules. That‚Äôs just wrong.
We need to pass a clean Dream Act no strings attached. Dreamers are counting on Congress to take action.
We can‚Äôt forget Americans in Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Island who are suffering many still without electricity &amp; access to food or water.
Even in terrifying and heartbreaking moments there are people who are willing to help strangers.
Over the weekend the GOP let a program expire that provides health insurance for 9M kids. Congress must re-authorize funding immediately.
We‚Äôve lost far too many of our classmates friends family members and children to gun violence. 
Senate GOP‚Äôs proposed 20-week abortion ban is another example of politicians playing politics with health care. #NoAbortionBan

Let me be clear: When we talk about patriotism and love of country it is about fighting for who we are and who we can be.
Building coalitions to wage our fight for justice is about love of country. It‚Äôs about patriotism.
We must replace the money bail system with a risk assessment system. We need to reform our broken bail system.
Let‚Äôs speak the truth that Puerto Rico deserves to be a priority just like our brothers and sisters in Florida and Texas.

Thank you for all the work you are doing to help Puerto Ricans. Your work is inspiring.   
On #NationalPublicLandsDay join me in celebrating the magnificent natural beauty our nation and state have to offer. 
We can't forget about the US Virgin Islands. Back-to-back storms left many struggling to recover. They also need our help. 
The people of Puerto Rico are suffering. They lack clean drinking water and many of them are without electricity. Congress must act now.

No American ‚Äãcity ‚Äãshould have to beg the federal government for help in the middle of a crisis. ‚ÄãWe must pass aid to PR now. 
Funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program expires tomorrow! Congress must act now on behalf of the 9 million children. 
DACA recipients: If your permit expires on or before March 5 2018 your renewal application must be received by October 5. 
Puerto Rico hospitals are at a standstill while they‚Äôre without power. Americans are suffering. We must help.
#EndMoneyBail is about ensuring bail is based on risk to the community not the amount of money someone has. 
The gap between the rich and the poor continues to rise. These inequalities must be addressed. 
Breast cancer is no match for my friend @OfficialJLD. Sending love and prayers.
During #HispanicHeritageMonth we honor C√©sar E. Ch√°vez who led marches and boycotts to protest farmworker treatment pay and conditions. 
We need to pass the #DreamAct as soon as possible. Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers are terrified. Let‚Äôs give them peace of mind.
Not reauthorizing CHIP funding would leave nearly 9M children vulnerable without health care coverage. Congress must act now. 
We have to take back Congress in 2018. It‚Äôs never too early to donate to local races or volunteer. Our success hinges on our mobilization.
We‚Äôve seen this before: Tax cuts for corporations while the middle class is left behind. 
Sen. Gardner and I called on Sec. Perry to work with American electric utilities to assist Puerto Rico in restoring electric services. 
GOP won't stop fighting to repeal the ACA. But that‚Äôs not what Americans want. Time to work together to improve it.
There is a humanitarian crisis going on in Puerto Rico. They are Americans. We can‚Äôt turn a blind eye.

Puerto Rico has gone through so much. We can‚Äôt forget that they need our help.
We can‚Äôt take anything for granted. The Graham-Cassidy ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill would gut Medicaid and cause costs to go up: (202) 224-3121.
This anniversary serves as a reminder that we must address the disparities in education for students of color.
The courage and bravery they embodied would pave the way for desegregation at schools but the struggle still persists today.
The Little Rock Nine as they came to be known would endure violent threats harassment and even have acid thrown on them.
Sixty years ago today nine Black students started at an all-white school following the Brown v. Board decision banning segregation.

Don‚Äôt stop calling writing letters and tweeting telling Senators to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. This isn‚Äôt over until Sept 30th.

You can be healthy one day &amp; sick the next. You never know what will happen in the future. That‚Äôs why we must #ProtectOurCare from the GOP.
Before the Affordable Care Act women were charged more just because they are women. We can‚Äôt go back. 
California is leading the charge against Trump‚Äôs unrealistic and wasteful border wall.

Lorna fought breast cancer now it‚Äôs our turn to fight for her &amp; every other breast cancer survivor who would be affected by #GrahamCassidy. 
Limited debate and no full CBO score. And the GOP wants to vote next week on the Graham-Cassidy ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill? Shameful.
Under the GOP bill:‚ùåPlanned Parenthood would be stripped of critical funding‚ùå Maternity care wouldn‚Äôt be required 
It would be an irresponsible to take health care away from tens of millions of people to back a flawed campaign promise. 
‚ÄúDreamers in the military face more than DACA deadline‚Äù
Let's redouble our efforts to ensure this ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill fails. Costs will ‚¨ÜÔ∏è care will ‚¨áÔ∏è &amp;coverage for many will disappear altogether

@JoeBiden: Brought by parents these children had no choice in coming here. Now they'll be sent to countries they've never known. Cruel.‚Ä¶
Ending DACA would cost CAs economy approximately $11B. Not only is rescinding DACA morally wrong it‚Äôll have negative economic implications.
@BarackObama: To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong because they‚Äôve done nothing wrong. My statement: 
Trump‚Äôs DACA decision undermines our nation‚Äôs values &amp; is a betrayal to the Dreamers who make our nation strong &amp; represent the best of us.
Add your name to urge GOP leadership in the Senate and House to hold a vote on the DREAM Act: 
My message to Dreamers: We see you. We stand with you. We will fight to ensure you can stay in the country you call home.
The heartless move to rescind DACA is a betrayal of our promise to Dreamers. It‚Äôs now on Congress to pass the Dream Act. Call (202) 224-3121 
Dreamers grew up in America. It‚Äôs their home. Ending the program deporting them back to a country they don‚Äôt even know would be cruel.
On #LaborDay we celebrate California workers and the labor movement that brought us a minimum wage weekends and other worker protections. 
Ending DACA would be nothing short of heartless. It's on us to demand a vote on the DREAM Act. We must stand with our Dreamers. 
@KamalaHarris: There is nothing crueler than deporting kids who grew up in America back to a country they don‚Äôt even know. #DefendDACA
‚ÄúI had to do a 'know your rights' training for little children for a 2nd grader and 6th grader and a 7th grader.‚Äù
Go Bison! Congratulations to my alma mater @HowardU on your hard-fought victory last night. #MissionPossible
There's no question that all people should have access to health care.
Big banks like Wells Fargo need accountability and consequences otherwise actions like these will continue. 
There is nothing crueler than deporting kids who grew up in America back to a country they don‚Äôt even know. #DefendDACA
@FWD_us: Must-Watch: @HallieJackson report on @NBCNightlyNews - as Jesus awaits a decision on #DACA - he continues to serve as a paramed‚Ä¶
Just like yesterday this weekend is going to be a scorcher across most of CA. Make sure to check in on your neighbors and the elderly.
California businesses are leading the charge and calling on Trump to keep DACA. 
Sweeping equal pay protections under the rug won‚Äôt make the wage gap disappear. This is a bad move for workers everywhere. 
Do you also support #MedicareForAll? I want to hear your story: 
From defending DACA to health care to infrastructure I‚Äôm committed to fighting for Californian‚Äôs needs in Washington.
Eid Mubarak to all Muslims who are celebrating in California and around the country. #EidAladha
I will fight tooth and nail to protect #DACA. Those young people have only known one home the U.S. Deporting them would be inhumane.
Health care should be a right not a privilege. if you agree: 
It‚Äôs clear that this administration wants to push the issue of sexual assault under the rug. We can‚Äôt let them. 
This is a moment in time that is challenging us not to turn a blind eye but to face &amp; confront the truths that are challenging this country
Had a great time meeting with California mayors earlier this week to discuss bail reform and more. 
@nowthisnews: Sen. @KamalaHarris calls on Trump to 'do the right thing' and protect young immigrants under DACA 
I‚Äôm absolutely committed to making sure we keep our promise to DACA recipients. #DefendDACA 
A little red white and blue and smiles all around for this #ThrowbackThursday from the campaign trail last year. 
Yesterday during the Oakland Town Hall I announced that I will co-sponsor Senator @BernieSanders‚Äô Medicare for All bill. 
When times are tough we stand together united. Help make a donation to support local nonprofits in Texas ‚Üí 
@MoveOn: Thank you for your leadership in fighting for Medicare for All @KamalaHarris 
I'm co-sponsoring @BernieSanders' Medicare for All bill because health care is a right. Add your name if you agree: 
DeVry recently settled for misleading prospective students with deceptive ads. Not fit to lead fraud office. 
@SenSanders: Thank you @KamalaHarris for your support. Let's make health care a right not a privilege. 
I intend to co-sponsor the Medicare for All bill because it‚Äôs just the right thing to do.
There are folks right now leading federal agencies that challenge the premise of those agencies. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
We must speak the truth: Racism homophobia sexism &amp; anti-Semitism is real in this country. We must change the laws to reflect our values.
People worry about getting a job keeping a job retiring with dignity. They don't think about things through the lens of partisanship.
I reject the premise that we‚Äôre a divided nation. There‚Äôs more that unites us than divides us. It‚Äôs important that we remind people of that.
To be effective as leaders we have to walk into rooms where people don‚Äôt have the same perspectives as we do. And speak up.
Anyone who wants to run for office needs to use their voice to organize on the issues that are front and center.
Like with public health it seems the current administration thinks that public education is a privilege not a right. It's deeply troubling
When we see injustice and when we see something that's wrong in this world let‚Äôs speak up let‚Äôs stand up let‚Äôs fight.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says we need to bring back the War on Drugs. Let's be clear ‚Äî the War on Drugs was an abject failure.
Republicans are playing politics with climate change on behalf of Big Oil. We gotta fight.
Trump‚Äôs trans military ban is a fundamental violation of people‚Äôs rights. We have to fight it.
California has 220K kids who are living in utter terror right now. This fight is real and present. We have to speak out to #DefendDACA.
The beauty about what happened with the Affordable Care Act was it showed that our democracy worked. The people spoke and the people won.
What we did to save the Affordable Care Act was phenomenal. You all stood up and made a difference.
For those who are confused about the wrong side ‚Äî they‚Äôre the one with the torches and the swastikas.
When we look at what‚Äôs been happening over the past 8 months it‚Äôs clear we must stand up. Be heard. Not turn a blind eye to what‚Äôs going on
Staff here! Watch the Oakland Town Hall live on @smrtgrls now:

We have more immigrants in CA than any state both documented and undocumented. Give them a chance to earn their citizenship.
California is home to 1 in 4 of the nation‚Äôs DACA recipients. That‚Äôs why I pledge to #DefendDACA. 
In times like these we see the best of our humanity. #HoustonStrong 
Trump‚Äôs border wall is a waste of money. We should be using that money for flood relief infrastructure and tuition-free college.

@francineorr: Senator Kamala Harris holds a round table in LA today with eight dreamers to discus DACA. @latimesphotos @latimes @KamalaH‚Ä¶
Our bail system is broken. That‚Äôs why I introduced a bail reform bill with Sen. Rand Paul to encourage reform to the practice of money bail.
If we‚Äôre going to be true to our values and our ideals then we must keep a path open for DACA recipients. 
Mahalia Jackson shouted these words to Dr. King leading him to improvise the most iconic section of his ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech.

Dozens of California‚Äôs emergency responders are heading to Texas to help with Harvey rescue efforts. 
Want to help those in Houston? Text HARVEY to 90999 to make a $10 donation to the @RedCross.
Americans helping each other out in this flooding is truly what our country represents. 
Hate is like a poison in the bloodstream of our body politic but we can‚Äôt let it become the new norm.
From DACA to climate change so many important issues being debated right now. Talk to your representatives &amp; tell them what matters to you.
The flooding in Texas due to #HurricaneHarvey is heartbreaking. Here's how you can help: 
Our current bail system is simply not fair. Bail reform is something people could feel good about getting done. 
We should not be punishing or turning away any American with the courage to serve our country. I stand with our transgender servicemembers. 
On #WomensEqualityDay I‚Äôm remembering the wise words of my mother: ‚Äúyou may be the first to do many things. Make sure you‚Äôre not the last.‚Äù
All Americans must stand up against the actions this Administration is taking to target communities.
Every action by this White House shows exactly which side of history they‚Äôre standing on.
He also gave an official presidential endorsement of racism when he pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
ICYMI late last night President Trump officially signed an order banning transgender Americans from serving in the military.
@ValerieJarrett: When @KamalaHarris &amp; @DrRandPaul agree that is a good sign reform is needed. Thanks @gailcollins!The New York Times ht‚Ä¶
All Americans are better represented when women have a seat at the table. #WomensEqualityDay
Trump said he‚Äôd ‚Äúshow great heart‚Äù by continuing DACA. It‚Äôs time for him to stand by those words and #DefendDACA.
The government made a promise to these kids who contribute to our country each &amp; every day as doctors students &amp; members of our military.
DACA has allowed immigrants brought here as children to come out of the shadows. Trump is poised to turn his back on them. #DefendDACA
Today in 1920 the 19th Amdt was adopted. We must pledge to increase the number of women in office. #WomensEqualityDay
The people of California are holding those impacted by Hurricane Harvey in our thoughts and prayers. 
This is wrong. By choosing to pardon Sheriff Joe Arpaio Trump is siding with discrimination. I stand in solidarity w/ the Latino community. 
@SenDuckworth: When I was bleeding to death in my Black Hawk I didn‚Äôt care if the troops saving me were gay straight transgender bla‚Ä¶
Forcing middle-class Americans to pay for corporate tax cuts is absurd. 
Whether someone is detained before a trial should be determined by whether they‚Äôre a risk to their community not whether they‚Äôre rich. 
Happy 101st birthday @NatlParkService! We must ensure all Californians have the opportunity to visit for generations to come. #FindYourPark
Sec. Zinke‚Äôs recommendation means more drilling logging and mining on public lands.
Hurricane Harvey is expected to make landfall tonight or tomorrow. If you‚Äôre in Texas &amp; surrounding areas please heed evacuation warnings. 
There are thousands of trans people serving in our military today. Add your name to stand with them. 
Trump is trying to hold the gov't hostage over a border wall we don‚Äôt need that could cost taxpayers ~$70B to build &amp; $150M/yr to maintain.
Not without a fight. 
Sam Clovis‚Äô anti-LGBT views are completely unacceptable and should have no place in our government.
This story is just one example of why we need bail reform now. 
Children are our nation‚Äôs future. We must listen to them about what they care about and give them a voice in our government. 
I applaud Attorney General Healey for taking on student loan companies and standing up for students. 
@emilyslist: .@KamalaHarris is inspiring us to rise to the challenges we face every day. #BarrierBreakers 
Banning transgender Americans from defending our country is un-American. We should welcome those who serve not shut the door on them. 
Each and every day we must fight to maintain our nation‚Äôs natural beauty because it‚Äôs not going to happen on its own.
Residents in nursing homes deserve the ability to seek justice in the court of law for negligence or abuse. 
We must reject the false choice that you can either have a strong economy or a strong environment. We can do both.
The answer to reforming our criminal justice system isn‚Äôt building more prisons or relying on mandatory minimum sentencing‚Äîit‚Äôs prevention.
‚ÄúOur ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others for their sakes and for our own.‚Äù ‚ÄîCesar Chavez
Lake Tahoe is one of the jewels of the world and we must do what we can to make sure we keep it blue and clear.
2.5M patients choose @PPFA every year including roughly 1M in CA. Cutting off funding would leave women with less access to affordable care
Political ideology should not come before Americans‚Äô health but that‚Äôs exactly what the head of the EPA is doing. 
The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr. Do the math. That‚Äôs less than $15000 a year ‚Äî not nearly enough to keep a roof over your head.
Happy Anniversary to my incredible husband @douglasemhoff! 
‚ÄúIt's time for the rest of us to stand up and say ‚ÄòNo not on our watch.‚Äô‚Äù
The government has a responsibility to address white supremacist violence. Add your name if you agree: 
The Senate Homeland Security Committee Democrats &amp; I are calling for a hearing on violent white supremacy to examine root causes.
if you firmly believe our country should work for everyone not just the top 1%.
Our nation‚Äôs natural beauty should be preserved for future generations not drilled and cut up into kindling. 
I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again: We need you. Our country needs you. The world needs you. Get out there speak truth ‚Äî and serve.
The partial #SolarEclipse2017 is about to start. If you‚Äôre viewing it don‚Äôt forget your solar eclipse glasses. 
Don‚Äôt let this go unnoticed: this Admin is reversing protections for student loans while padding the pockets of predatory debt collectors.
ICYMI: The Federal Bureau of Prisons will now ensure female inmates have access to essential health care products.
As Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm said ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt give you a seat at the table bring a folding chair.‚Äù Make your voice heard.
I strongly believe in protecting workers‚Äô rights for all Californians from increasing the minimum wage to improving workers compensation. 
If we raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour four million black women would see their incomes rise. #RaiseTheWage
While you‚Äôre preparing for the solar eclipse by hunting down some glasses the people who run California‚Äôs electric grid are also preparing. 
Dreamers are serving in our military going to college and working in Fortune 100 companies. We must keep our promise and #ProtectDACA.
Leaving future Affordable Care Act subsidy payments up in the air is sabotage plain and simple. 
When companies are yielding unheard-of profits at the expense of human life it‚Äôs time to negotiate prescription drug costs.
It‚Äôs time to address the underlying issues in our educational system that limit black girls‚Äô opportunities before they even reach college.
Glad that former Corinthian Colleges students will be receiving an additional $51 million in student loan relief. 
Good news ‚Äî The Sand to Snow National Monument is officially safe from this administration‚Äôs attempts to shrink CA‚Äôs protected public lands. 
Each and every day let‚Äôs continue to live by example and prove once and for all that America is a strong nation because of our diversity.
We have a broken criminal justice system. But in order to fix the system we must reduce recidivism and focus on crime prevention.
To tackle 21st-century challenges we must empower women and families. If we do not lift up women and families everyone falls short.
Trump‚Äôs proposal to allow companies to deny birth control coverage will cost women more.
After the financial crisis we won $20B from big banks for CA homeowners. I've fought to ensure corporate profits don't come before families
A reckless move that would roll back building standards aimed at reducing flood-related damages.
#TBT to when I was sworn in for a second term as San Francisco‚Äôs District Attorney by @SenFeinstein who‚Äôs now my colleague in the Senate. 
My heart goes out to the victims in Barcelona their families and the community at this time. 
We need to reform our criminal justice system by transferring from a money bail system to a system based on risk assessment. 
The truth is that the vast majority of Americans are good fair and just ‚Äî and they want their country to reflect those ideals.

If the first seven months are any indication the Trump admin is prioritizing corporations ahead of America's health
Proud to represent a state that is finding creative ways to act on climate change.
Americans will pay the price (premiums will increase by 20% next year) if Trump sabotages the Affordable Care Act. 
Women are 50% of the population but hold only 23% of seats in legislatures across the globe. It‚Äôs time to change that.
As we‚Äôve seen throughout history in the fight for justice &amp; the fight for freedom‚Äîchange won‚Äôt happen if we don't challenge the status quo
‚ÄúWe must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim.‚Äù ‚ÄîElie Wiesel #WednesdayWisdom

@CREDOMobile: Kamala Harris Slams Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòMany Sides‚Äô Rhetoric On Charlottesville
Abandoning efforts to get all communities to sign up for health care coverage is sabotage plain and simple. 
Now it‚Äôs in jeopardy under this admin. The president should live up to his words and ‚Äúshow great heart‚Äù by continuing DACA. #DefendDACA
With DACA recipients were allowed to contribute to the only country they‚Äôve called home. They went to college and opened small businesses.
Today marks the 5th anniversary of DACA. It was created with a very important purpose‚Äîto allow kids brought here to come out of the shadows.
We don‚Äôt have to let extremists define us. Opportunities to do right are right in front of us every day. We just have to seize them.
Love justice equality and tolerance will defeat racism white supremacy violence and hate. 
@NAACP: ‚úäüèø‚úäüèæ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèº‚úäüèª 
Make no mistake: all of us have a responsibility to speak out against the hatred and bigotry perpetrated by white supremacists.
It‚Äôs easy to tweet hate has no place here. But no legislator should be horrified on Saturday &amp; then vote to drag America backward on Monday.
‚ÄòMany sides‚Äô is what kept children in this country at separate schools and adults at separate lunch counters for decades. 
@Seth_Lemon: #UnionSquare 
Heather Heyer was tragically killed in service of the idea that our diversity is our power. It‚Äôs on us to honor her memory with action.
If we say this is not who we are it‚Äôs on us to show that. We don‚Äôt have to let extremists define our nation.
Every single day we must choose hope over despair and love over hatred. We are a stronger nation because of our diversity.
It‚Äôs 2017 and we‚Äôre at an inflection point. Now is the time to look in the mirror and ask ourselves what kind of nation we want to be.
RIP Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Charlottesville yesterday. 
Heather Heyer 32-years-old was the victim of white supremacist violence yesterday in Charlottesville. Rest In Peace. 
We must speak out against white supremacists hatred and bigotry. Find a #Charlottesville vigil near you: 
This is un-American. We must all stand against hatred and bigotry. Our unity is our strength and diversity is our power. 
@DonnaFEdwards: For me #BlackGirlMagic means that we can and do have many voices...we always have.
Playing politics with our health care system and Americans‚Äô hard earned cash is just wrong. 
It‚Äôs simple: we must protect the right to organize to rebuild our middle-class. 
Sometimes in order to make change you‚Äôve got to change how change is made. Do not listen when naysayers say progress can‚Äôt be done.
Equal opportunity is only possible when women have safe affordable access to reproductive health care ‚Äî including abortion.
@NCLRights: Thank you @KamalaHarris for standing with us and taking a stand against the #TransMilitaryBan! 
The effect of this Administration‚Äôs anti-immigration push is being felt‚Äîentire fields of vegetables are spoiling before they can be picked.

I will never stop fighting for the people‚Äîbe it against this White House Wall Street for-profit colleges or those who target the voiceless
From melting glaciers to rising sea levels we can‚Äôt ignore the evidence‚Äîhumans are contributing to climate change.
As Attorney General for California I refused to defend Prop 8 even though it went to the Supreme Court. It was simply unconstitutional.
We have many fights ahead of us including climate change tax reform and more. Get ready. We‚Äôre going to need you in the days ahead.
We stand with you.
Today we remember #MikeBrown and recommit to ensuring truth transparency and trust in our criminal justice system. #BlackLivesMatter
That's just where we start but the bottom line is this: inaction on income inequality should no longer be an option.
On top of that we need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act College for All Act and guarantee paid sick and family leave for every worker.
Tie the minimum wage to inflation to make it a true living wage. Then Washington can‚Äôt keep playing politics with our economic security.
Here are some places to start: raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. If you work full-time you should be able to support your family.
An economy that only works for those at the very top is an economy that is broken. Thread below on ways we can address income inequalityüëáüèæ 
Getting rid of the open and fair internet is a direct threat to CA consumers. That‚Äôs why we must fight for #netneutrality.

Every decision we make has a profound impact on our children‚Äôs future whether it‚Äôs college affordability or protecting our environment. 
Pay disparities are not a reality we should accept. It‚Äôs critical we combat the economic injustices that exist for both gender and race.
A California-based moving service is helping women move out of their homes &amp; escape abusive relationships for free. 
Income inequality is skyrocketing. That‚Äôs why we have to be fierce advocates for the most voiceless and vulnerable.
Consumers right to join class-action lawsuits against banks is at risk. We must protect consumers and vote no on overturning this rule.

I applaud @JerryBrownGov‚Äôs efforts to make CA a leader on climate change. Climate change is not a hoax &amp; we must act
Voting is a fundamental right and we must protect it for everyone. The battle continues even today.
However in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted a key section of this act. It‚Äôs vital we update &amp; reinvigorate the protections of this act.

I'm glad to see the CFPB continue its work to hold the big banks accountable for ripping off their customers. 
The vast majority of Americans have so much more in common with one another than what separates them.  
As we fight the GOP‚Äôs terrible health care agenda we have to talk about ideas that will make health coverage a right for all Americans.
Lowering prescription drug costs for seniors is common sense. That‚Äôs why I signed onto Senator Klobuchar‚Äôs bill that would do just that.
Happy birthday President Obama! Thank you for all you‚Äôve done for our country. 
The federal minimum wage is too low to support a family. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve supported raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Black women are about 7% of the population but make up just 2% of scientists and engineers. We need to fix that.
Women made up the majority of calls into Congress during the health care fight demanding to be heard. It‚Äôs clear: women won‚Äôt back down.

By the end of their careers on average Black women will have made $840040 less than their white male counterparts. #BlackWomenEqualPay
Black women must work nearly 20 months just to earn the same amount white men earned in 12 months. Unacceptable. #BlackWomensEqualPay

Walk with your chin up and your shoulders back. Be proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished together. And then let's get back to work.
A democracy yields to the voices of the people. And last night the people spoke.
Last night proved that we are stronger when we raise our voices together.
Tonight health care was saved for millions of Americans. This is your victory. Your calls letters and courage made this possible. 
Premiums up 20% compared to current law. Health care ripped away from 16M more Americans. This isn‚Äôt a plan it‚Äôs a disgrace. 
It‚Äôs 10 p.m. ET. The Senate GOP just released the text of the #SkinnyRepeal. They want to vote on it in the dead of night. Indefensible.
Make no mistake ‚Äî access to affordable and meaningful health care should be thought of as a human right and civil right.
This health care bill will affect the lives of everyone. Parents. Grandparents. Children. Costs will go up. Care will go down.
@AFLCIO: Don't let up. Call your senators at 888-865-8089. This is a matter of life and death. Be heard! 
Here are the faces of people with pre-existing conditions. Let‚Äôs save the ACA for them. 
We must stop the terrible health care bill from passing the Senate for children with pre-existing conditions like Natalie. 
"16 million‚Äîthat‚Äôs how many Americans the GOP wants to rip health care away from with their so called ‚Äúskinny repeal"""
"Cuts to Planned Parenthood would deny countless women access to critical reproductive care. We can't pass this ""skinny repeal."" "
Don‚Äôt ‚Äãvote for a bill you don‚Äôt want to become law.
Keep doing what you‚Äôve been doing because it‚Äôs working it matters &amp; it counts. We have less than 24 hours. Let‚Äôs keep calling &amp; we will win
‚ÄúMy son now three was diagnosed with an atrial septal defect at one years old and had open-heart surgery at 19 months old‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Health care should be a right not a privilege for just the wealthy or the healthy. #SaveACA by calling (202) 224-3121 now.
The GOP wants to vote in a few hours on a health care bill that hasn‚Äôt even been written yet. Americans deserve better than a secret bill. 
Children‚Äôs stories deserve to be heard in this health care process which is why I‚Äôll be sharing some throughout the day. 
This is it the final push to save health care for millions of Americans. Today is critical. Make those calls: (202) 224-3121.
As a society we need to stop playing politics with our fundamental right. Health care should be a human and civil right.
There are millions of vulnerable Americans who can't be involved in the health care fight. We need to be their voice
The support against the final Senate health care vote coming later this week must be overwhelming. Jam the phone lines. Flood inboxes.
Millions of lives hang in the balance with the final Senate health care vote later this week. 
They may have many versions but any final bill Republicans want us to vote on will badly hurt millions of Americans.
We can still win this and make sure that the 5M Californians who gained health insurance under the ACA get to stay covered. #SaveACA
Let's ramp up the pressure this week. Your calls tweets emails and actions have made a difference. Stay active. (202) 224-3121.
3. Tell your story. Time to redouble our efforts and keep up the work.
2. Join any and all protests against this health care bill. Use your voice to show Republicans that we won‚Äôt be silent.
1. Reach out to friends and family in states with Senators who voted in favor of the motion to proceed. Make sure they‚Äôre calling/writing.
A lot of you have asked how to help the health care fight if you live in a state with Democratic Senators like California. Thread below:
We should honor the courage of Americans who volunteer to sacrifice for our nation not turn them away.
This is discriminatory and un-American. To the transgender servicemembers who defend our nation I stand with you. 
Republicans just voted to move their health care vote forward. This is shameful and we must keep it from passing. Turn up the pressure. 
As Senators we were sent here to represent the American people. Time for my colleagues to represent Americans &amp; vote NO on health care bill
This health care vote is about what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing stories like Niketa‚Äôs. 
It‚Äôs critical we defeat this health care bill once and for all. Say you‚Äôre with me‚Üí
To my GOP colleagues: Forget the politics. Forget partisan pressure and ads. Instead listen to the voices of the American people.
Today‚Äôs the day. Keep focused:Health careHealth careHealth careHealth careHealth careCall your Senators now at (202) 224-3121.

Don‚Äôt have any regrets after the health care vote on Tuesday. Call everyone you know talk with everyone you know. Tell them to take action.
We have to use all of our energy all of our power over the next two days and tell the GOP they can‚Äôt take health care away from millions.
Republicans are trying to take dignity away from Americans. We can‚Äôt stop and we won‚Äôt stop keeping up the pressure on health care. 
Many of you have asked how you can share your health care story with me. You can do that here: 
Right now women can be shackled in prison while they are pregnant and in some states even while they give birth. That‚Äôs wrong.

Black &amp; Latino Americans are disproportionately hurt by our bail system. That‚Äôs one reason why @RandPaul &amp; I introduced a bail reform bill.
@nytopinion: Our bail system is broken. And it‚Äôs time to fix it say @KamalaHarris and @RandPaul

At a time when our government is led by people who refuse to listen to the voices of the American people we must stay active.
We have to be smarter when thinking about how we treat women in the criminal justice system before during and after incarceration.

We‚Äôve gotten to a point in America where for many‚Äã writing a check or not determines whether or not you stay in jail.‚Äã That's wrong.
Senator Rand Paul and I have introduced a bill to encourage states to reform the money bail system.

I visited the Central California Women‚Äôs Facility a few weeks ago. Read more about my visit there:
Revoking #NetNeutrality would further the digital divide in California. Low-income families and rural businesses deserve better.
Every single time Republicans have come back with a plan it‚Äôs somehow even worse. 32M more uninsured people by 2026 than under current law. 
The health care fight is not over yet. We have to keep fighting. We have to keep up the pressure. We have to keep calling: (202) 224-3121.
We made a promise to young DACA recipients. We can't go back on that and I will continue to #DefendDACA each and every day.
Voting rights matter. We must protect those rights at all costs for everyone no matter the color of their skin or income. #RespectMyVote
We have to keep showing up to fight the GOP‚Äôs radical agenda ‚Äî on health care on taxes and many more important issues.
Make no mistake: this ban disproportionately affects women and children.
Because of your phone calls tweets and emails the Senate GOP‚Äôs repeal plan is defeated (for now). But we must keep up the fight. 
The war on drugs was a failure. Whole populations of people have been incarcerated for what is essentially a public health issue. 
It‚Äôs clear: We must rethink criminal justice policy in terms of prevention first. #WomenUnshackled
The answer to fixing the criminal justice system is not to build more prisons or privatize those prisons. #WomenUnshackled
We‚Äôve been offered a false choice about the criminal justice system. We are either tough on crime or soft on crime‚ÄîI say be smart on crime.
We must be a voice for the most vulnerable and voiceless and work to give them dignity. #WomenUnshackled 
Staff here ‚Äî did you know women are the fastest growing segment of the US prison population? Yet they are too often not addressed in policy.
Going to be a part of the Women Unshackled forum on female incarceration at the @Newseum today. My staff will be tweeting from the event.
I will always defend the progress we‚Äôve made to protect our environment and to address the global crisis of climate change.
We should be doing more not less to prevent students from being defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges.
Time to abandon this bill once and for all and work together to strengthen our health care system.
Progress is won and lost with every generation. ‚ÄãThe gains we make may be incremental at times but that doesn‚Äôt mean we stop fighting.
"They're trying to take away our health care and we say ""don't take our stuff!"" We must continue to fight together arm in arm against this."
Thank you. The phone calls the tweets and the letters are making a difference.

It‚Äôs wrong that the latest Senate bill gets rid of the ACA requirement that insurance companies cover certain essential health benefits. 
Cutting Medicaid will have life-or-death consequences for families across the country. We have a chance to defeat this bill but we need you

Keep the pressure: (202) 224-3121 is the number to the Capitol switchboard. Memorize it. Save it to your favorites. Call early &amp; call often.
American people will actually lose their health insurance *faster* under the Senate version compared to the House bill. Don‚Äôt stop calling. 
A bill that harms millions of Americans to give tax breaks to the wealthy is not a health care bill. It‚Äôs downright immoral. Keep fighting. 
This is because of you but our fight is far from over. Keep up the pressure. Keep up the calls: (202) 224-3121. Health care is at stake. 
The #CBOScore confirmed it. The Senate bill covers fewer Americans and costs people more especially seniors.

Here‚Äôs the thing: Healthy people can become sick people in the blink of an eye. We should make it easier to get care not harder.
Taking health care from those in need to give big tax breaks to the top 0.4 percent of the wealthiest Americans is shameful.

Show the GOP that millions of Californians and Americans are standing against this disastrous plan. Add your name ‚Üí
This weekend we must keep up the pressure on the Republican ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill. Make those calls.
Accreditors must determine if this is in the best interest of students. 
The GOP knows what‚Äôs at stake ‚Äî people‚Äôs lives. Share your health care story with me: 
We are being asked to vote on a bill that has life-or-death consequences for Americans without one hearing. They deserve better. 
As US Senators we were sent to DC to represent the American people &amp; to answer to them. How many of my GOP colleagues can say they do that?
The President of the United States called the House version of the health care bill ‚Äúmean.‚Äù The Senate version? Mean-er.
When Gilbert Baker created the rainbow flag in 1978 he refused to trademark it because he wanted it to belong to the entire LGBT community. 
Senate Dems &amp; I are calling for a decrease in taxpayer funding for Trump‚Äôs deportation force which is disastrous. 
#TitleIX was signed 45 years ago today &amp; since it was enacted has transformed educational opportunities for women. 
Americans deserve better than the Republican ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù bill which will devastate people‚Äôs lives rather than making their lives better.
‚ÄúIn November of 2016 I received one of the worst diagnoses a woman can get: breast cancer‚Ä¶‚Äù 
@PPact: 1 in 5 women of reproductive age relies on Medicaid.#Trumpcare slashes Medicaid.#BetterCare is insulting.#IStandWithPP htt‚Ä¶
More women are dying during childbirth in the U.S. than in any other developed country. It's only going to get worse if this bill passes.
This is what happens when you shut women out of the process. Who could've possibly predicted?
There are more women in the Senate than ever before. It‚Äôs a start but we can't lose any Dem colleagues in 2018:  
To my fellow Senators I say: Stand up and stop the GOP health care bill. Speak that truth. Now is not the time to keep quiet.
‚ÄúMy daughter was born with a blood disorder called Hereditary Spherocytosis‚Ä¶‚Äù #HealthcareBill 
Stay up-to-date on the latest goings on in California and across the nation: 
Happy birthday to two dear colleagues of mine: @SenFeinstein and @elizabethforma! Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for this nation. 
.@BarackObama is right this #HealthcareBill (if you can really call it that) is a fundamental attack on our nation‚Äôs values and character. 
Cuts to Medicaid means:‚¨áÔ∏è $ for families to pay for nursing homes‚¨áÔ∏è support to children with special needs‚¨áÔ∏è $ to treat substance abuse
Now is not the time to stay silent. Call your Senators now: (202) 224-3121. We must stop the shameful GOP #HealthcareBill.
And we can‚Äôt forget that costs will increase ‚Äãfor seniors ‚Äãand millions will lose coverage. All this just ‚Äãto give tax breaks to the wealthy
The GOP #HealthcareBill gives states a loophole to get rid of essential health benefits incl. maternity care and mental health treatment.
It makes draconian cuts to Medicaid that will impact our nation‚Äôs children low-income Americans and ‚Äãseniors‚Äã.
The GOP released their #HealthcareBill today. Let me be blunt: it‚Äôs worse than we thought. Here are some main takeaways: 
All of us in Congress should be trying to help not hurt the people we represent. We owe it to them to vote down the GOP #HealthcareBill.
We have a challenge ahead of us in 2018. But it‚Äôs never too early to get started ‚Äî progress takes time. Donate to local races. Volunteer.
ICYMI: I released a @spotify playlist for African-American Music Appreciation Month. 
After graduating Kye Allums parlayed his career into advocacy work and is now a mentor to LGBT youth &amp; a transgender advocate. #PrideMonth 
Now we know why the GOP hid their health care bill it's as bad as the House bill:-Millions lose coverage-‚¨ÜÔ∏ècosts¬†-Massive Medicaid cuts 
Just awful. Child fatality numbers related to guns in the U.S. is higher than any other high-income country. 
The GOP wants to vote next week on a health care repeal that we don‚Äôt even have the text of. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Call (202) 224-3121 now.
We cannot despair ‚Äî progress does not happen overnight. It‚Äôs time to roll up our sleeves and continue to fight for our values.
The GOP health care repeal would leave many who need opioid treatment without coverage. Cutting back on resources is foolhardy. 
Thank you to all the people who fought hard in Georgia and South Carolina. We‚Äôll need that enthusiasm across the nation in 2018.
No public hearings. No debate. No text.No transparency. On behalf of the American people I demand the GOP #ShowUsTheBill.
If the federal government won‚Äôt step up California will. 
Republicans want to conceal their health care repeal bill because they know it‚Äôs nothing short of a disaster. 
It‚Äôs just plain irrational to cut MediCal when 4600 Californians are dying every year from substance abuse and opioid overdoses.
The ACA went through 106 public hearings incorporated more than 170 Republican amendments &amp; the entire process took a year.

We need people like @Ossoff in Congress who will fight for our civil liberties &amp; our values. #GA06 get out &amp; vote! 
Yesterday I joined my Democratic colleagues to hold the Senate floor. It‚Äôs outrageous we haven‚Äôt seen the health care repeal bill.
We can‚Äôt afford to lose sight of critical issues like equal pay protecting our environment for future generations &amp; criminal justice reform

To my colleagues I say: This is about what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong. If you know this bill is bad stand up and stop it. #HoldTheFloor
I don‚Äôt care who you voted for ‚Äî this health care plan will not solve anyone‚Äôs problems. It will devastate people‚Äôs lives. #HoldTheFloor
"if you agree with Kamala: ""It is wrong and irrational to cut Medicaid."" #HoldTheFloor"
I‚Äôve met folks all across the country and in CA. They know what‚Äôs happening. If it was good it would be out in the open! #HoldTheFloor
We answer to the American people. So why are my colleagues from across the aisle trying to put one over the American people? #HoldTheFloor
The process of the ACA took an entire year ‚Äî yet this process involves no hearings no public text no transparency at all. #HoldTheFloor
This health care bill will affect the lives of everyone. Parents. Grandparents. Children. And it‚Äôs is being written in secret. #HoldTheFloor
Joining my colleagues in a few moments to speak out against the health care repeal bill. My staff will live tweet my remarks. #HoldTheFloor
Black women vote at a higher rate than other groups yet are continually underrepresented in elected office. 
It‚Äôs a tragedy that families in America have to choose between keeping their lights on and paying their medical bills. 
Tomorrow is our chance to #FlipThe6th and elect @ossoff who will stand up and fight for progress in Georgia.
No one should have to be afraid to walk home from their place of worship. This is devastating. 
This #Juneteenth we celebrate emancipation and remember those who have fought for freedom. We must continue their work.

It‚Äôs absurd that Trump would even consider hurting Americans by sabotaging our health care system. 
.@SenFeinstein and my message to President Trump: Stay away from California‚Äôs national monuments. 
It's true - I love superhero movies. You can‚Äôt help but love Wonder Woman who‚Äôs unapologetically strong &amp; independent. 
We should be taking steps to move forward on civil rights investigations in schools and universities not taking a giant leap back. 
If this past week has shown us anything it‚Äôs that we are stronger together than we are divided.
Jim Obergefell wanted to be recognized as the surviving spouse on his husband‚Äôs death certificate. Doing so he helped so many. #PrideMonth

#AHCA is being crafted in secret with no hearings no bill text and no transparency. We need to make our voices heard: (202) 224-3121. 
Those who spoke out told their story and pressed this administration made this happen. But we must keep up the pressure. 
The women of the Senate will continue to seek the truth no matter what. Support them now:

Here‚Äôs a not-so-startling fact: the GOP health care bill is unpopular everywhere. 
Half a million strong. Together we will continue to speak truth to power and work to ensure equal opportunity and justice for everyone.
Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to turn to the internet and the kindness of strangers to pay for their medical bills. 
The news of a senseless act of gun violence at the San Francisco UPS facility is heartbreaking. Please keep the community in your prayers. 
Horrified by what happened in Alexandria this morning. My heart goes out to Steve Scalise staffers the US Capitol Police &amp; their families.
It‚Äôs time to focus on local elections this year and midterms in 2018. We have to take back the House and Senate!
The Attorney General is supposed to serve the American people not Trump or whoever may be in office at the time. #SessionsHearing
While everyone's focused on Russia we can't forget the GOP is trying to pass a healthcare bill that would take away insurance from millions
The women of the United States Senate will not be silenced when seeking the truth. Fight back: 
It was a simple question. Can Sessions point to the policy in writing that allows him to not answer a whole host of our questions today.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù Did you refresh your memory with any written documents? #SessionsHearing
Hi Twitter! Kamala‚Äôs staff here. Tune in now to watch the Senator question AG Sessions. We'll be live-tweeting:

Today marks the one year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in US history. We will never forget the 49 precious lives that were lost 
@KamalaHarris: Good. We deserve the truth. 
Trump has shown he‚Äôs willing to go to extreme lengths to cut core govt functions to the bone in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy.
In 1997 Ellen Degeneres became the first lead in prime-time sitcom history to come out on air. 
ICYMI: Earlier this week I questioned former FBI Dir. Comey about possible contacts between Trump camp and Russia: 
Show you will stand up and fight to bring justice and tolerance back to our government not passively sit by:  
There‚Äôs nothing more powerful than a group of determined people marching and standing up for what we know is right. #ResistMarch
Our loyalty should be to the Constitution not an individual. 
"this if you've ordered your ""Courage Not Courtesy"" sticker and want your friends and family to get one too."

Saving the #ACA will save lives. Take a look back at how insurers used to treat people with preexisting conditions ‚Üí
"@clairecmc: So Rs saw the video &amp; said I was ""ranting and raving""  Help me in 18 if you liked my rant! "

While we were all focusing on the Comey hearings the House GOP voted to roll back Wall Street reform. Disgraceful. 
Nothing about this hearing should distract us from the fact that the GOP is still trying to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
At the end of the day #ComeyHearings were about uncovering facts information &amp; the truth about this investigation. We deserve answers.
Wanted to share my recap of this morning‚Äôs #ComeyHearing: 
Here‚Äôs what we know from #ComeyHearings:‚úîÔ∏èHe was concerned Trump would lie about their mtgs‚úîÔ∏èComey wants Mueller to have full independence
At this point there are still far too many questions about whether Sessions has truly recused himself after being caught lying to Congress.
ICYMI: I asked Comey Qs about possible secret contacts b/w the Trump camp &amp; Russian officials. He declined to answer in the open session.
Reminder: Amidst this Russia investigation Republicans are still trying to take away your health care.
@ACLU: Sen. Harris was right to ask whether Jeff Sessions really did recuse himself from Russia/Trump. #ComeyTestimony

Hi all ‚Äî staff here. If you don‚Äôt have the TV tuned in right now you can watch Kamala‚Äôs questioning here: 
My staff will be live tweeting during my line of questioning during the Comey hearing so make sure to stay tuned here. #ComeyDay
That's what today is about ‚Äî the facts the information and the truth so we can decide what the next step is in this investigation.
Finally this is not a TV show. This is about the office of the presidency and the integrity of our government. We need the truth.
Second I've taken the oath of office many times. The oath is to the Constitution. Trump's asking for loyalty is completely inappropriate.
I have many questions for him that I intend to ask and am hopeful they are answered today so we can get to the bottom of this.
First Comey's statement validates many of the news stories that show Trump interfered in the FBI investigation.
Before today's Comey testimony I want to share very quickly with you what I am thinking at this moment in time. #ComeyDay 
Here's the truth: I will never give an inch when it comes to truth and accountability in our government.
The faith and integrity of our democracy is at stake. We must find out the truth. 
This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue ‚Äî the Constitution and the American people need to be prioritized over party and personality. 
He should. He lied to Congress about meeting with Russian officials. 
The American people deserve to know whether the special counsel is fully independent. We need the truth. I won't stop until we get it. 
Congratulations to @JimmyGomezCA on your win last night! Looking forward to having you in Congress ‚Äî I know #CA34 is in good hands.
In the 80‚Äôs the LA sky was thick with smog. Then smart policy was made and now you can see the sky in LA. We can‚Äôt go back.

Bobby Kennedy once said ‚ÄúNo martyr‚Äôs cause has ever been stilled by an assassin‚Äôs bullet.‚Äù Remembering him today‚Äîhis work won‚Äôt be forgotten
We must reform our criminal justice system to be ‚Äúsmart on crime‚Äù and insist on a better return on our investment.
Please take a quick moment to take my issues survey ‚Äî your feedback has been invaluable these last five months: 
On the 73rd anniversary of #DDay we remember the heroism of those who fought on the beaches of Normandy. 
Drug addiction touches every community and every family in our country. It‚Äôs going to require working together to solve this crisis. 
Live in #CA34? Don‚Äôt forget to get out and vote for @JimmyGomezCA who I know will stand up for our values. Polls are open until 8 p.m. 
It‚Äôs up to us to fight to protect a woman‚Äôs right to make her own decisions about her own health. This administration won‚Äôt.
California‚Äôs earthquake early warning system‚Äôs rapid progress could collapse if Trump‚Äôs proposed budget is passed.

The ACA has been saving lives since 2010. Trumpcare will do the opposite. If passed 14M more Americans will be uninsured next year.
More than 4600 Californians die each year from opioid overdoses including heroin. We need to be doing more‚Äînot less‚Äîto address this issue.
Since Trump has so far failed to nationally recognize #PrideMonth I wanted to take some time this month to highlight the LGBTQ community. 
Memorize the number (202) 224-3121. Keep up the calls on climate change and so many other key issues. They're making a difference.
From universal background checks to getting weapons of war off our streets we must do more to end gun violence. #WearOrange

In @humansofny fashion I will be sharing personal stories of people who have benefited from the ACA and could suffer if it‚Äôs repealed. 
The #ACA has helped numerous entrepreneurs gain health insurance and even get their businesses off the ground. 
In states that waive essential health benefits out-of-pocket spending could increase by thousands of dollars. 
A budget is a reflection of our values. Through this budget it‚Äôs clear that this Admin prioritizes those at the top not working families.
Completely eliminates the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program leaving 132700 CA students without an after-school program.

Trump‚Äôs budget would make the wealthiest Americans wealthier and leave the middle class behind. That‚Äôs the wrong direction for our country.
Under the #TrumpBudget &amp; millions in cuts to Head Start 11030 CA children will no longer receive high-quality child care or early ed.
ICYMI: Senator Feinstein and I introduced legislation that would protect farmworkers from deportation. 
Our open internet is being threatened. Add an official comment to the FCC now and help save #NetNeutrality: 
Don‚Äôt overlook a critical piece of the #TrumpBudget: Trump‚Äôs blatant attacks on @PPact and women‚Äôs health. 
Who benefits if the internet is made less free &amp; less open? Cable companies.
Trump‚Äôs proposed budget is downright cruel. It prioritizes the 1% while leaving the middle class in the dust.
While all women deserve equal pay today is #MomsEqualPay Day. On average a mom typically earns 71 cents for every dollar a dad earns.
Today is #MomsEqualPay Day the day mothers who work full time year-round catch up to the pay fathers received from 2016.
I‚Äôm pleased the Department of Transportation has done the right thing. This project will create thousands of jobs in our state. 
Devastating news coming out of Manchester. While information is still coming in my heart goes out to the victims' families.
Latinos are 2x more likely than white Americans to be incarcerated for drug offenses. Our criminal justice system is broken &amp; must be fixed.
As your United States Senator I won‚Äôt rest until we get to the truth.
"@emilyslist: ""If you vote for people to lose their healthcare then you need to lose your job."" - @KamalaHarris "
Harvey Milk's courage continues to serve as an inspiration to us all. #HarveyMilkDay 
I‚Äôm cosponsoring the #CollegeforAll Act w/ @BernieSanders because it‚Äôs time to start investing in America by investing in education.
We must recognize the richest legacy we will ever leave our children is clean water to drink &amp; clean air to breathe.
Undoing everything President Obama passed will make us worse off especially for our environment. 
ICYMI: Unsurprisingly Trump expanded the Global Gag Rule DURING #WomensHealthWeek. 
I promise you that as your Senator I will fight to protect net neutrality rules. We can‚Äôt let corporate internets win. #NetNeutrality
Horrific: The rise in the opioid epidemic has nearly doubled in 7 yrs the number of babies born affected by drugs.
The War on Drugs was bad for public safety bad for our economy and bad for those struggling to make ends meet. 
With an opioid epidemic raging across our country we don‚Äôt need another war on drugs. We need to address drug addiction head on.
There‚Äôs more than one way to be an activist. Here‚Äôs how you can get involved if protesting isn‚Äôt your thing: 
We win when we fight for the value that healthcare is a fundamental human right.
It‚Äôs ludicrous that Trump wants to cut the EPA‚Äôs budget to its lowest level in 40 years adjusting for inflation. 
We must keep up the fight.
Let‚Äôs tell these Republicans in Congress it‚Äôs time to stop playing politics with people‚Äôs lives. We won‚Äôt rip away insurance from millions!
Let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and recommit ourselves to doing the work and fighting the fight. Let‚Äôs take our country back. #CADEM17
The real power does not reside in Washington D.C. It lives in each and every one of us. And it is up to us to take our country back.
We need answers. Too often it seems like this administration‚Äôs real priority is ‚ÄúRussia First America Second.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs keep up the fight for civil rights. Women‚Äôs reproductive rights are at stake. LGBT rights are at stake. Voting rights are at stake.
This administration is targeting our scientists but we know policies need to be based on science fact ‚Äî not science fiction. #CADEM17
Let‚Äôs hold these Republicans accountable in their districts. If you vote for people to lose their health care you should lose your job!
Hate &amp; xenophobia are like a poison infecting our body politic. CA has a huge stake in this fight ‚Äî &amp; a responsibility to keep up the fight.
We‚Äôre facing fundamental fights over fundamental rights including:‚ÜíFreedom of religion ‚ÜíFreedom of the press ‚ÜíRight to vote ‚ÜíRule of law
I‚Äôm honored to address this convention for the very first time as the United States Senator from the great State of California! #CADEM17
Going to be speaking at the @CA_Dem State Convention. While I‚Äôm giving my remarks my staff will tweet some highlights. #CADEM17
With everything going on we must multitask. Keep your eyes on Russia but don‚Äôt lose sight of health care immigration &amp; climate change.
Powerful women persist. 
Net neutrality rules ensure the gatekeepers of the internet can‚Äôt tilt the competitive playing field. We must keep the internet free &amp; open.
A staggering number of families have been broken up by this administration under the false pretense of safety. 
#FlashbackFriday to when I met this woman with an incredible hat while traveling across the state in 2016. 
The President of the United States disclosed more to Russian officials than the American public. This isn‚Äôt normal. 
Jeopardizing health care coverage for millions goes against our nation‚Äôs values. 
@RollingStone: California Sen. Kamala Harris goes after Jeff Sessions for his ‚Äúdark ages‚Äù drug sentencing directive 
For some in rural communities Planned Parenthood clinics are the only place to get care. Politicians must end their assault on PP. 
The internet is one of the most powerful tools to making your voice heard ‚Äî we must protect a free and open internet. #NetNeutrality
Trump is undermining the public‚Äôs confidence in our government and our democracy. Watch now: 
For those of you with student loans this isn‚Äôt shocking: Student loans account for 10.6% of all household debt.
The idea that the Trump admin brought Flynn in knowing he was under investigation is unfathomable. 
And folks let me tell you: These crises have so much more in common than what separates them.
The FCC voted today to start a process that would change the free and open internet as we know it. We must protect #NetNeutrality. 
My friend @AmericaFerrera is hosting a livestream with advocates from the front lines. Tune in @ 5pm ET  #ActivismIRL
I know there‚Äôs a lot going on right now but we need you. Call your members of Congress and tell them to #SaveACA at (202) 224-3121.
We‚Äôve neglected our infrastructure for far too long. This is one issue we can &amp; must work together to fix. #NationalInfrastructureWeek
Drug addiction is color blind. It doesn't see red or blue. This is not an urban or rural issue. This is an American issue.
Their stories may differ but they all show California‚Äôs rich diversity. 
It‚Äôs time we start treating addiction as a disease rather than a crime. 
A Special Counsel was appointed because of your voices and a free press. Keep speaking up.
This admin says average families will be better off under Trump‚Äôs tax ‚Äúplan.‚Äù That may not be the case for some homeowners. 
With Sessions and Rosenstein compromised this was a necessary step forward. 
Sixty-three years later it‚Äôs critical we reflect on Brown v. Board &amp; work to close the educational disparities gap that still exists today.
Had the court ruled differently I and many others across the nation would not be where we are today.
Almost two decades after this landmark ruling I was part of only the second class to integrate the Berkeley public schools.
This was a major day in our nation‚Äôs history and impacted the lives of many including my own.
On this day in 1954 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. üì∑: Thomas J. O'Halloran 
Today on #IDAHOBIT we continue pushing for a world of inclusivity and acceptance because #LoveIsLove ‚Äî no matter who you are.
We need to get to the truth. This is a necessary next step. 
As I said yesterday progressive prosecutors are key to criminal justice reforms like rolling back mass incarceration and ending cash bail. 
We need to treat drug addiction not as a crime to be punished but as a disease to be treated.
What do X-Men and the job market have in common? Quite a lot actually.
700 to 900 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes every year in the U.S. Many deaths are preventable.
We are well past the tipping point. When will the GOP put country over party? 
From visiting a doctor for preventive screenings to getting physically active make your health a priority on #NWHW:  
The war on drugs ‚Äãwas an abject failure which affects all of our communities especially ‚Äãthose struggling. We can‚Äôt turn the clock back. 
Speaking at the #CAPIdeas Conference around 12 p.m. ET. Watch here: 
Trump revealing highly classified intelligence was reckless &amp; jeopardizes national security. Sign if you agree: 
Instead of bringing back laws that lead to mass incarceration @TheJusticeDept should address systemic inequities in our justice system.
I curated the Presidential Daily Brief for @ozy this week. Discover the must-know news now‚Üí 
If true this is a serious threat to national security. 
I‚Äôve said it before and will again ‚Äî we must have a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI‚Äôs Russia investigation. This cannot wait. 
Unable to afford expensive dental work many Americans simply put it off.  
Speak truth and serve. We need you. Our country needs you. The world needs you. #MondayMotivation
An important win for voting rights: a major voter suppression law will not be reviewed by the Supreme Court. 
It was good to be home this past weekend at @HowardU.
American public servants swear loyalty to the Constitution ‚Äì not the President.
It's my commitment to mothers everywhere to fight any of Trump's policies that undermine maternal health and rights.
Staying engaged is crucial especially in times like these. If you're troubled by what you see in the news stand with me &amp; join the fight.
Each and every day my mother continues to inspire me to fight for what is right. #MothersDay 
Wishing everyone a happy #MothersDay!

There is nothing normal about what‚Äôs happening surrounding the Russia investigation and Comey‚Äôs firing. We deserve the truth.
We should be helping opioid victims heal ‚Äì not taking away resources for recovery.
Once again congratulations to the class of 2017 ‚Äî your @HowardU family will be with you every step of the way on your new journey. 
It's past time for meaningful criminal justice reform including addressing the for-profit bail system. 
Harnessing technology in meaningful ways can help us improve education &amp; ensure that our nation's future is bright.
@mayaharris_: So proud to see my sister @KamalaHarris give the @HowardU commencement address in its 150th anniversary year. üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì 
Lengthening sentences for nonviolent offenders is not the answer. Sessions' draconian sentencing order perpetuates mass incarceration. 
This is a terrible idea. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and ignore this global crisis. 
Congratulations @HowardU graduates! 
As you begin the next and exciting phase of your life it is your duty to let your guiding principle be to speak truth and serve.
You don‚Äôt need a big title to make a big difference. If you see something wrong do the right thing. It will make a difference.
You may be the only one in the room who looks like you. But wherever you are you must remember this: You are never alone.
Speaking the truth means you must speak up and you must speak out.
There's no limit to what you can do. You must detect &amp;reject false choices. If we‚Äôre going to make progress anywhere we need you everywhere
You must ask ‚Äî how will you serve and lead? My advice:-Reject false choices-Speak truth-You don‚Äôt need a big title to make a difference
Graduates ‚Äî we have a fight ahead. It‚Äôs a fight to define what kind of country we are and what kind of country we will be.
You‚Äôre part of a legacy that has endured &amp; thrived for almost 150 years. Endured when the doors of higher ed were closed to black students.
Remember you are blessed because you now have the gift ‚Äî the great gift ‚Äî of a @HowardU education.
I've had the honor of speaking at many commencements but this one is special for me. I've sat where you're sitting right now.
It‚Äôs good to be home. Greetings Bisons! Thank you for this incredible honor. To the class of 2017 ‚Äî congratulations!
@douglasemhoff: Pre Howard U Commencement address with my amazing wife and proud Howard grad @KamalaHarris!

Proud to be an alumnus of #HBCU @HowardU! We'll be live-tweeting tomorrow's commencement speech so be sure to tune in at 10:45 ET.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking be investigated:- Jeff Sessions‚Äô role- Political interference from the WH- Allocation of resources
I sent a letter w/ my colleagues ‚Äãto the DOJ Inspector General urging him to investigate political interference in the Russia investigation.
Comey‚Äôs firing and Trump‚Äôs statements in the last 24 hours are a grave threat to our system of justice. It‚Äôs time for action.
Jeff Sessions wants to turn back the clock on the progress we‚Äôve made on sentencing reform‚Äîand we must speak out against it. 
.@BernieSanders The plan:‚úÖFree college tuition for those making &lt; 125K/yr‚úÖProvide assistance for non-tuition costs‚úÖLower student loan interest rates
I've introduced legislation w/ @BernieSanders to make college tuition-free for most Americans. We have to address student loan debt.
An affordable college education continues to be a pipe dream for millions of Americans. This escalates that crisis.
This is why we should be developing new clean energy solutions
There‚Äôs nothing about any of this that is normal. 
"The GOP ""plan"" to strip affordable access to vital prenatal care will devastate the health of future generations."
Free press is what helps set us apart from dictatorships. We shouldn't be arresting reporters for doing their jobs.
There‚Äôs something seriously wrong with the potential target of an investigation firing the man in charge of that investigation. 
It's been clear for months ‚Äî Sessions should resign. 
@KamalaHarris: Sessions lacks all credibility to be the head of the Department of Justice. He should have resigned months ago.
Climate change is an issue that we must address now not later. This is a huge victory for our environment.
There are plenty of productive uses for federal funds that better the lives of Americans ‚Äì this is not one of them.
WH actions say to Americans that if you have money if you have power you can just change the rules - that the justice system is fixed.
Sessions lacks all credibility to be the head of the Department of Justice. He should have resigned months ago.
This courageous DREAMer shows us that one person can make a difference when they stand up for what‚Äôs right.
Trump‚Äôs firing of Comey threatens the integrity of the entire justice system. We need a special prosecutor.
The time to fight climate change is now ‚Äì not once our children have to deal with the consequences of our inaction.
It was a pleasure joining @PodSaveAmerica for a lively discussion of the state of the nation. Hear the episode here: 
They can spin this all they want but the Muslim Ban is unconstitutional and an affront to our values. 
Howard has instilled countless students with the drive to serve others. I'm proud to be giving @HowardU's commencement speech this Saturday.
This is not a time for partisanship. We deserve to know the truth on Russian interference in our elections. Period.
We cannot wait any longer to have a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI's Russia investigation. 
From its drafting process to its content the GOP health bill shows complete &amp; utter disregard for women.
"""To state the obvious you don't want your national security adviser compromised by the Russians."" ‚Äì @SallyQYates"
Repealing the ACA would be a disaster for CA. 4.8M people would lose coverage and 141K would lose their jobs.
This really shouldn't be that difficult. 
.@POTUS44 is right ‚Äì standing up for what's right takes great courage. 
The stories of these brave young Angelinos underscore the need for compassionate immigration reform.
On #NationalTeacherDay we celebrate the teachers that work tirelessly to change us for the better ‚Äì like my 1st grade teacher Mrs. Wilson! 
Our kids deserve the truth. Their generation deserves access to clean air and clean water.
The decisions that members of Congress make in their districts impact you. Now is the time to write call and make your voice heard.
Saying people won't die without health care is like saying people won't starve because they don't have food.
Supporting women in the workforce isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issue‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic issue.
Thank you to all the inspiring teachers in CA and across the nation who help our students learn each and every day. #TeacherAppreciationWeek
We need to take crimes against women and children more seriously ‚Äî crimes like human trafficking domestic violence and child abuse.
SIGN NOW: Urge my Senate colleagues to oppose the GOP health care bill: 
Bringing more women into government yields better policy and stronger communities. 
I joined my colleagues to urge funding for long-term care for our nation‚Äôs veterans. 
We must stay vigilant in defending justice equality and tolerance. Take some time today to make those calls &amp; write those letters.
Older Americans with lower incomes would be worse off under the #AHCA. 
Here‚Äôs something Republicans don‚Äôt want you to know: their plan jeopardizes protections for people with employer-based health insurance.

If you're one of the up to 129M people who have a pre-existing condition share your story with me today &amp; I‚Äôll some throughout the day.
We cannot despair or give up at a time when so many are counting on us to keep fighting. We need you.
Add ‚Äúbeing a woman‚Äù to your list of pre-existing conditions the GOP health care bill may not cover. 
It‚Äôs shameful the #AHCA passed the House but I will do everything I can to ensure its defeat in the Senate. 
Calls are the single most effective way to make a difference in the fight against the #AHCA. Call your Senators now: (202) 224‚Äì3121.
Please RT: Here are some ways you can take action right now to help defeat the #AHCA in the Senate:
The GOP health care plan is just a shallow attempt to pass a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the most vulnerable in our society.
Health care should not be a privilege for a few but a right for all. The bill that passed earlier today won‚Äôt do that.
Progress is won &amp; lost with every generation. We must stand up &amp; speak out for the 3-4M in CA who would ‚Äãlose insurance.
Our fight is far from over. A majority of Americans oppose this catastrophic health care repeal &amp; we WILL work to stop it in the Senate.
@CecileRichards: BREAKING: The House just passed the worst bill for women in a generation. The #AHCA blocks access to PP takes coverage‚Ä¶
This bill isn‚Äôt just about medicine it‚Äôs about our values as a nation. It‚Äôs time to roll up our sleeves and fight for that. Let‚Äôs go.
Once again 129M people with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage and insurers could charge sick people more money.
The Affordable Care Act saves lives. The GOP health care plan? This plan will destroy lives.
The callous and carelessly-written GOP health care plan will roll back any progress we‚Äôve made over the last few years.
Disgraceful: Republicans in the House just voted to strip 24M Americans of their health care. I will do everything in my power to fight it. 
A vote for the GOP health care plan is a vote against children with special needs. #VoteNoAHCA
Before the ACA was passed being sexually assaulted was considered a pre-existing condition. We can‚Äôt go back.
Here‚Äôs what would be considered a pre-existing condition under the GOP plan:‚Üí Domestic violence‚Üí Sexual assault‚Üí C-section#VoteNoAHCA
Health care for 24M people is up in the air. Urge your members of Congress to #VoteNoAHCA. Lives are literally at stake: (202) 224-3121.
The latest health care bill would gut Medicaid and other key protections. Call your representatives now and tell them to oppose it. #VoteNo
Yesterday I was proud to join my colleagues in reintroducing the Equality Act in Congress which will do just that.
When running for Senate I pledged to fight to include sexual orientation &amp; gender identity as protected classes in the Civil Rights Act.
This Administration should not bully California cities. I‚Äôm proud of our leadership on this issue. 
I support a woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her own health care. It shouldn‚Äôt be up for debate.
@CoryBooker: This is 1st time ever 3 black Senators are serving at same time. Today we were recognized by The Urban League @KamalaHarris‚Ä¶
Thanks to the ACA 129M Americans w/pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage. We must keep it that way. 
Health care should be a right not a privilege for just the wealthy or the healthy. #SaveACA by calling your reps at (202) 224-3121. 
TAKE ACTION: Join National Call-In Day and tell your representatives to oppose the new health care bill ‚Üí (202) 224-3121. #SaveMyCare
When a group of people are being denied fundamental services like public education public health &amp; public safety that‚Äôs an injustice.
Now it‚Äôs not just their abusers they fear ‚Äî it‚Äôs also the government. 
A victory yesterday in the fight against so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ people. We must end this terrible practice. 
Publically humiliating students in order to have their parents pay school lunch bills is despicable.

The GOP healthcare plan guts protections for people with pre-existing conditions. To put it simply it‚Äôs a bad plan. 
#13 - Save your Congressional representative phone numbers to speed dial. Call often. 
To our brothers &amp; sisters in immigrant communities across the nation‚Ää ‚Äî ‚Ääknow that we are fighting for your rights. #MayDay2017
It‚Äôs time we stop burdening our students with outrageous amounts of debt and start lowering tuition costs. 
They can deny it all they want but climate change exists ‚Äî and it's up to all of us to address it. 
From economic inequality to paid family leave I stand with workers this #MayDay2017. 
In the next 100 days of Trump‚Äôs presidency we cannot tire. We cannot tire because there is too much at stake.
Dividing hard-working families ‚Äî separating them and deporting them because we suspect they *may* have committed a crime ‚Äî is immoral.
ICYMI: I joined my colleagues in co-sponsoring the Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act banning conversion therapy.
When every voice is heard when every voice is valued when we are unified we can succeed.
Here‚Äôs a look at some of my favorite photos taken at the @WomensMarch 100 days ago. 
The richest 1% have seen their income grow by 15% since 2009 yet pay for workers have stagnated or fallen. We must #RaiseTheWage.
It‚Äôs been 100 days since the @WomensMarch. We must continue that fight. ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèª‚úäüèø‚úäüèº‚úä‚úäüèæ 
This administration‚Äôs open hostility to climate change is appalling. No matter what California is ready to tackle this challenge head on.
Offshore drilling poses a clear threat to the health and well-being of Californians. 
We can‚Äôt allow ourselves to get to a point where this is normal. #Trump100Days
.@RafaelAnchia's speech speaks truth to power ‚Äî when history examines TX's stance on immigrants will you be on the right side of history? 
For every step forward there are a few steps back. The fight for equal pay in the workplace continues. 
There‚Äôs nothing more powerful than a group of determined sisters brothers and friends standing up for what‚Äôs right. #ClimateMarch
During #Trump100Days we‚Äôve seen the power of resistance and how your actions can make a huge impact. Fight on.
The United States should be leading on climate change action not rejecting it. #ClimateMarch
Today marks Trump‚Äôs first 100 days as president. I‚Äôll let his actions speak for themselves. #100Days 
As income inequality skyrockets we must work to reverse it by supporting policies that will build an economy that works for everyone.
Strategically upgrading our crumbling infrastructure will help to create jobs and improve our economy.
Since day one Trump has shut women out of the process and targeted our rights. #100Days
Angry about the proposed budget cuts? Do something about it. Write a letter. Call your member of Congress. Speak out. Every action matters.
Weapons of war should not be readily available in our neighborhoods &amp; on our streets. We must renew the assault weapons ban. #NRAAM2017
We cannot allow national treasures like these get opened to logging mining &amp; oil drilling because of Pres. Trump.
Excited to join the @Recode Conference next month with @laurenepowell! 
While the government shutdown was averted for now we must work together next week to ensure another shutdown doesn‚Äôt happen again.
Raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would generate $144 billion in higher wages stimulating local economies.
Trump‚Äôs tax ‚Äúplan‚Äù is nothing more than another attempt for Trump to enrich himself and his corporate donors.
Trump is committed as ever to his border wall but there are better uses for those taxpayer dollars. 
I condemn President Trump‚Äôs Executive Order that threatens the status of California‚Äôs national monuments. 
From healthcare to our environment there are many fights ahead of us. With your help we can win them. Call your reps at (202) 224-3121.
The minimum wage must be a living wage. That‚Äôs why I joined my colleagues in support of a $15 minimum wage bill.
We can‚Äôt roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions. It‚Äôs just wrong. 
Happy birthday to my friend Senator @CoryBooker! 
Yesterday I co-sponsored a bill that would ban conversion therapy nationwide.
Corrected link: Anti-Semitic incidents have risen by 86% in the first 3 months of this year. This is alarming.
Amaiya will finally be able to enter the ring after being forced to forfeit a boxing match in November because she was wearing a hijab. 
Trump‚Äôs budget wants to cut scientific research to cure cancer. We can‚Äôt let him ‚Äî these cuts will harm public health &amp; medical innovation.
Offshore drilling is harmful to the environment which is why I'm co-sponsoring legislation that would ban it. 
‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.‚Äù ‚ÄîNelson Mandela #WednesdayWisdom 
Once again the GOP is trying to repeal the ACA. Your voice matters. The Capitol switchboard will connect you to your reps at (202) 224-3121. 
Here‚Äôs what we don‚Äôt need to do: give more tax breaks to corporations when working families are struggling.
ICYMI ‚Äî here‚Äôs the GOP agenda this week:üî¥ Rip health care from 24M peopleüî¥ Bring back pre-existing conditionsüî¥ Cut taxes for the wealthy
Trump may want to roll back the clock on regulations to reduce car emissions‚Äîbut CA won‚Äôt go down without a fight ‚úä
It‚Äôs 2017. The people of Flint MI still have to use bottled water to cook. 
Sign your name if you agree: Congress should not approve any funds for Trump‚Äôs unrealistic border wall.
This mixed messaging coming from this Admin is harmful and causes uncertainty and fear among DREAMers.
The pay disparity for black women is simply alarming. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fighting for #EqualPay. 
I agree. Young people are our nation‚Äôs future &amp; it‚Äôs critical we ensure they have the skills necessary to succeed.
We should be taking care of families working people seniors and veterans not wasting money on tax breaks for corporations.
A budget is a reflection of our values. It tells a story about who and what we care about. We should be investing in our people not walls.
‚ÄúIf legislators don‚Äôt act by the end of April miners will lose their health-care benefits.‚Äù
We are not a society and a community that should stand for tearing families apart. We won‚Äôt bow to this admin‚Äôs fear mongering.
This weakens our society and lets criminals get away with crimes ‚Äî making all of us unsafe. 
It's no coincidence corporate interests are thriving with Trump in the White House.
This past weekend showed that across the nation we will defend science. And we always will.
Instead of a wall here‚Äôs what we should use that $ for:‚úìRebuilding our infrastructure‚úìIncrease access to health care‚úìTuition-free college
It is morally wrong for corporations to profit off the mass incarceration of millions of people in this country.
Maybe instead of wasting money on an unrealistic border wall we spend that $ on infrastructure across the country?
ICYMI: I held a town hall on Friday and took questions on health care Trump‚Äôs border wall and more. 
It‚Äôs time for the GOP to stop playing politics with public health.
Diversity is critical to ensuring all voices are represented when decision-making. We deserve better. 
We can‚Äôt let @Mineworkers lose their health benefits and pensions on April 30th. Call Congress at (202) 499-6044 now. #KeepThePromise
Repealing the ACA would cost CA up to 200000 jobs. These jobs ‚Äî &amp; these people ‚Äî are worth fighting for. if you‚Äôre with me.
Cuts to the @EPA could mean more children will get lead poisoning. We can‚Äôt let that happen. 
We must #KeepThePromise to the 20000 retired @mineworkers and protect their health care. Call Congress at (202) 499-6044 to help now.
California will never stop fighting to protect our environment and save our planet for future generations. 
You can‚Äôt deny the evidence.
The anti-climate agenda coming out of this admin is wrongheaded. The majority of Americans want to protect the environment. #EarthDay
Thank you to everyone who came out to my town hall yesterday! 
Proud to stand in solidarity with all those who are marching in California &amp; throughout the country as part of the #MarchForScience today.
In 1970 #EarthDay was started by Sen. Gaylord Nelson after he traveled to CA to see the effects of the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara. 
California has made major strides to reduce air pollution but we still have a long way to go. 
Denying the vulnerable a safe haven for help will mean more unreported crimes and communities will live in fear.
Trump‚Äôs border wall could cost taxpayers $70 billion to build and $150 million a year to maintain. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
"""Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every generation.‚Äù - Coretta Scott King"
We are all in this together. We are unified by our common values. That‚Äôs why we need to recommit ourselves to coalition-building.
Pruitt is questioning the impact of CO2 on climate change. We‚Äôre now forced to debate whether science should be the basis of public policy.
Pay attention to local races. It‚Äôs not all about DC. It‚Äôs about your backyard. There is nothing too small to put your energy into.
Donald Trump needs to release his tax returns. What does he have to hide?
Just last week I was in Iraq and Jordan and I visited with Syrian refugees. 70% of all Syrian refugees are women and children.
I am absolutely opposed to privatizing prisons and the same goes for detention centers for immigrants.
Give people a path to citizenship. The vast majority of folks we‚Äôre talking about are living a lawful life and paying taxes.
It‚Äôs ludicrous to say we‚Äôre going to deport 12 million people. Now how are you going to do that?
We are not a society that is going to stand for tearing families apart. We are not going to buy into this administration‚Äôs fear mongering.
An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal.
If we‚Äôre going to be a nation that says we care about families then we need to be a nation that takes care of families.
The war on drugs was a failure. It criminalized what is a public health matter. It was a war on poor communities more than anything.
You can watch Kamala‚Äôs town hall live here: 
Trump‚Äôs border wall is just a stupid use of money. I will block any funding for it.
Health care is essential. It is directly connected to our ability to achieve equality for all.
The fight to save the Affordable Care Act is still on. The best defense we have are your stories. Know that they make a difference.
Staff here. Kamala is participating in a town hall at Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. We‚Äôll tweet some highlights.
4/10 mothers are their family‚Äôs primary wage earner. Equal pay isn‚Äôt just about fairness in the workforce it‚Äôs about justice for families.
#FlashbackFriday to a rally we hosted on the campaign trail with Dolores and Emilio Huerta in Bakersfield. 
Please sign our petition opposing the GOP‚Äôs latest attempt to rip health insurance away from millions of people.
This would be catastrophic for the 129 million Americans who have some form of a pre-existing condition.
The Administration‚Äôs proposed 21% cut to the @USDOL would negatively impact job training programs. 
Before the ACA 1M veterans didn‚Äôt have health insurance. That # was cut almost in half after it was implemented.
Lowering tuition costs for college students at public colleges and universities must be a priority. #CollegeForAll

I sat down with @nbcbayarea to discuss the vetting process for refugees &amp; the work we have to do in the future.
Sessions should have resigned a month ago for lying to Congress ‚Äî now he‚Äôs attacking a federal judge just like POTUS. Enough. 
Honored to write about my friend @elizabethforma for #TIME100. She always stands up for the marginalized ‚Äî period. 
The GOP‚Äôs new health care plan may hurt people with pre-existing conditions. This is unacceptable. 
Make sure to give a high five to all the people in your life who are fighting for reproductive justice. #NationalHighFiveDay 
More than 250000 DREAMers reside in California. We cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families.
There‚Äôs a lot of work left to do and we have to keep fighting for: ‚úÖ Safe communities‚úÖ Civil rights‚úÖ Good jobs‚úÖ Immigration reform
ICYMI: I recently came back from my first trip to the Middle East as U.S. Senator. 
We must fight for the vulnerable and voiceless and make our country a safe equitable place for all families to live and thrive. 
It‚Äôs #NationalParkWeek ‚Äî pack your picnic basket because all @NatlParkService parks are free this weekend!
This shouldn‚Äôt happen. We owe it to members of the military to ensure their families are supported. 
The open hostility by this administration to the notion of climate change is alarming. We should be leading on this issue not rejecting it.
I discussed my trip to the Middle East with @ABC7. Watch now: 
In the 2015-16 school year 7.3% of elementary students in CA missed 10% of the school year. Taking the school bus could help. 
This is callous and a betrayal of our values. These young people know no other home than ours. 
Sign my petition to tell Trump we shouldn‚Äôt withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords:
The goal of the Paris Agreement is simple: reduce fossil fuel use in order to address climate change. Abandoning it = abandoning our planet.
Best wishes to @ossoff today in #GA06 and to all those who are working hard to win this election. Make calls here: 
I was overseas last week visiting the Za‚Äôatari Refugee Camp in Jordan and meeting with CA servicemembers in Iraq. 
Asking President Trump to release his tax returns isn‚Äôt about party or politics it‚Äôs about transparency in the White House. #TaxDay
It‚Äôs clear that California‚Äôs leadership on climate change has never been more important. 
Truth transparency and trust in our criminal justice system will help make our communities safer. 
Thank you @Essence for honoring me among so many incredible activists &amp; changemakers. The fight continues. #Woke100  
From the archives: 
Fear is leading many immigrant families to forgo health care services even if their children are eligible for them.
The wildflower bloom this year is so monumental ‚Äî you can even see it from space!  
From my family to yours happy Easter! 
Upset about this administration‚Äôs actions? Call your representatives. Write them a letter. We must be unflinching in our values.
States across the country are working to restrict women‚Äôs access to abortion. It‚Äôs up to all of us to stop them. 
Today and tomorrow visit a national park for FREE! #FindYourPark here &gt;&gt; 
‚ÄúHarris a Democrat is quite vocal with regards to student issues.‚Äù
Prevention not reaction is key to a smarter and fairer criminal justice system. 
No matter what the Trump admin tells you the numbers don‚Äôt lie ‚Äî the number of uninsured Americans dramatically decreased under the ACA. 
It‚Äôs 2017. You would think by now that women would have the right to control their own health care decisions.
It is clear that our nation will not be made stronger with Trump‚Äôs budget ‚Äî including cuts to meals for seniors cancer research and more.
Preserving the progress made on climate change is critical but we must also take bold action to further improve our planet. Are you with me?
Special interests &amp; big corporations have spent millions to buy elections. This is wrong‚Äîwe must reform our broken campaign finance system.
This weekend &amp; next weekend entrance to all National Parks is free! Which park do you want to check out? 
Americans have the right to know who is meeting with officials in the White House. After all it's their house. 
Remembering this little girl who had a powerful message at the @womensmarch. 
Trump quietly signed legislation yesterday that allows states to blatantly discriminate against women‚Äôs health providers. 
In the face of enormous challenges we must recognize that our diversity is our power. We are strongest when we all stand together.
When criminals can get away with victimizing people without punishment it makes all of us unsafe. 
Thank you for everything you have done for the cause of justice and equality. I‚Äôm humbled by the fact that I would not be here without you. 
Building President Trump‚Äôs unnecessary wall will cost billions of dollars plus millions a year to maintain. 
In California 38% of jobs will require a bachelor's degree or more by 2020. That‚Äôs why I joined my colleagues in pushing for #CollegeForAll
This will raise health care costs for Americans‚Äã.‚Äã ‚ÄãPOTUS shouldn't jeopardize health care just to make a political point. 
High standards‚Äã aim to prevent misconduct‚Äã and corruption‚Äã. We should not lower them. 
While this is positive news we must work to close the achievement gaps for Native American &amp; Black students. 
Programs that help solve crimes are under attack by the current administration. 
When 2000+ Southern Californians die early each year due to polluted air we must not remove smog standards.
Throughout my life I‚Äôve prioritized fighting for children because each and every child deserves a fair shot at success in life. 
An in-depth look at intimate partner violence and why it‚Äôs so important we continue to discuss this issue: 
Predatory practices by student loan giants are despicable. We must demand accountability. 
It‚Äôs unbelievable the GOP wants to defund Planned Parenthood and restricting access to critical reproductive care.
Refugees fleeing violence deserve compassion. Trump must reverse his misguided refugee policy. 
Please tell me your priorities and thoughts as we approach the end of Trump‚Äôs first 100 days ‚Üí
We need to hold big banks accountable. 
This adorable dog was at one of my rallies last year. Who are you celebrating this #NationalPetDay? 
Every single day more than three women lose their lives because of domestic violence. We can‚Äôt let this continue. 
We must pass legislation to ensure equal pay &amp; family-friendly workplaces ‚Äî including a national paid family leave.
To all those who are celebrating tonight wishing you a happy and blessed Passover! Chag Sameach!
Using taxpayer money to build a border wall that most Americans don‚Äôt want to fund is just plain foolish.  
Almost 40% of California‚Äôs full-time year-round workers are immigrants. 
At a time when women‚Äôs health is under attack it‚Äôs up to all of us to join the fight. Thank you @shondarhimes!

No one should have to be afraid to put a menorah on their front window or on their front lawn.
It‚Äôs outrageous that to earn what the average white male earns by age 60 black and Latina women would have to work until they‚Äôre 80 or 90.
Schools churches hospitals &amp; courthouses should all be safe places not places of fear for immigrants.
When people say you can‚Äôt do something show them you can.

@HRC: A message from @CoryBooker &amp; @KamalaHarris to the @HRC community... ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíöüíôüíú 
While he may understand the narrow text of the law he has failed to show that he understands the meaning of ‚ÄòEqual Justice Under Law.‚Äô
He consistently sided w/ corporations while ruling against women workers the LGBT community &amp; people with disabilities and special needs.
After a careful review of his record it was clear that Judge Gorsuch would not do that which is why I voted no on his confirmation.
These words are there to remind all those who enter that the Supreme Court exists to uphold rights of all Americans‚Äînot just the powerful.
Above the doors of the Supreme Court are etched the words ‚ÄòEqual Justice Under Law.‚Äô
There are real and lasting consequences to student debt including hurting future chances of buying a home.
#TBT to the 2012 Democratic National Convention with @TammyForIL who has been an extraordinary hero of mine. 
if you believe it‚Äôs time to pass a federal law to require national paid family and sick leave.
Would DHS Sec Kelly put his verbal policy not to separate mothers and children at the border in writing? No. 
Judge Gorsuch record shows that he lacks sound judgment to uphold justice. 
No one should have to live their life in fear due to their religion race or ethnicity.
It also calls on the Trump admin to offer federal assistance to victims and institutions of faith and worship that have been targeted.
More must be done to end these crimes and resolution calls on federal law enforcement to investigate all credible reports.
Yesterday I worked with Sen. Rubio Feinstein &amp; Collins to pass a resolution to combat crimes against racial religious &amp; ethnic minorities
Americans deserve a Supreme Court justice who will protect the rights of women in the workplace. Judge Gorsuch won't. #StopGorsuch
Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs record shows he‚Äôs willing to favor corporations over the American people. #StopGorsuch
Add your name to become a co-sponsor of our bill to ensure every American can earn a tuition-free college education:

In the 21st century women who work shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between taking care of themselves or a loved one &amp; putting food on the table.
The GOP just won‚Äôt give up their Obamacare fight ‚Äî and this time they want to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 
This is welcome news. Elevating Bannon set a dangerous precedent and was against the best interests of the country. 
.@DHSgov Sec Kelly said he verbally informed staff not to separate mothers/children at the border but won't commit to putting it in writing.
This is a big win for the LGBT community and our nation. Discrimination betrays the values of our democracy. 
The average student takes on $30000+ in debt. The #CollegeForAll Act would address this &amp; costs beyond tuition including books &amp; housing.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for speaking up tonight to filibuster Gorsuch‚Äôs disastrous nomination. #HoldTheFloor 
At the rate we‚Äôre going women won‚Äôt be paid as much as men until 2152. #EqualPayDay 
On the 49th anniversary of Dr. King‚Äôs assassination we must remember his words: ‚ÄúThe time is always right to do what is right.‚Äù

In California women earn 85.7 cents for every dollar a man makes. We must do better and close the pay gap. #EqualPayDay
Our daughters should not grow up believing that their work is worth less than a man‚Äôs. Read my @TeenVogue op-ed: 
We can‚Äôt piecemeal our nation‚Äôs budget if we want to ensure the public health and safety of especially vulnerable Californians.
‚ÄúWe need positive role models we can look up to and hopefully emulate to true success.‚Äù ‚Äî Haneefah Adam
Trump‚Äôs proposed budget does not include sufficient resources for after-school programs. We must do better for CA's children.
A running list of what the Trump administration has done to squelch environmental progress: 
Give it up. It‚Äôs time for President Trump to abandon his efforts to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Taking bold action on climate change can improve our economy &amp; our air quality. That‚Äôs why as AG I defended the Clean Power Plan.
Selling a customer‚Äôs most sensitive personal data to the highest bidder without their consent is just plain wrong. 
I didn‚Äôt back down on Proposition 8 and I won‚Äôt back down now ‚Äî we must ensure equality for all Americans. #Throwback 
I joined my colleagues in introducing a bill that would rescind the executive order to construct Trump‚Äôs border wall
About 1 in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder which is why days #WorldAutismAwarenessDay is so important.
Rejecting scientific findings because they‚Äôre from a different administration is harmful to public safety.
When every day brings a new attack on our values it‚Äôs up to us to be vigilant in defending the cause of justice equality &amp; tolerance.
In case you have time to check it out this weekend ‚Äúsuper blooms‚Äù have been sprouting up across California. 
Sending my condolences to civil rights lawyer William Coleman's family and friends. His work on Brown v. Board forever changed our nation. 
Together we can end sexual assault. #SAAM 
All issues are women‚Äôs issues. It's important we don‚Äôt relegate women to just one set of issues as though every issue isn‚Äôt a women‚Äôs issue.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the GOP‚Äôs harmful rhetoric ‚Äî the Clean Power Plan that Trump rolled back would have created tens of thousands of jobs.
Gilbert Baker's contributions to the LGBT community won't be forgotten. 
On the last day of #WomensHistoryMonth I wanted to recognize my mother Shyamala Harris a breast-cancer researcher. 
I strongly believe an informed public is one of our best weapons against future cyberattacks by the Russians.

By the year 2030 President Obama‚Äôs Clean Power Plan would have prevented 3600 premature deaths per year. Rescinding this is harmful.
"""There are 2 powers in the world; 1 is the sword &amp; the other is the pen. There is a 3rd power stronger than both that of women."" #WHM "
President Trump continues to put corporate interests ahead of clean air which is shortsighted. We must move toward a clean energy economy.
We must work even harder to protect Americans from future Wall Street greed and predatory practices.
Russia attacked the heart of our democracy and they can ‚Äî and will ‚Äî do so again if we don‚Äôt urgently act. #SenateIntelligenceCommittee
How can we expect to represent our brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community if we don‚Äôt even recognize them in the 2020 Census? 
A victory for women athletes everywhere. 
The GOP didn't have the votes to prevent millions of women from getting cancer screenings &amp; birth control. So the @VP broke the tie. Awful. 
#TBT with my friends and colleagues @MaxineWaters and @RepJohnLewis ‚Äî don't mess with them! 
As Attorney General I took on transnational gangs cyber criminals and mortgage fraud. Every day I continue that commitment to justice.
Electing Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court would be bad for Americans but good for corporations. #NoGorsuch 
It's irresponsible for this admin to paint a whole population of people as racists murderers and 'bad hombres.' 
2.5M people across the country use @PPact for birth control &amp; other services. I stand with Planned Parenthood today &amp; every day. #PinkOut
Just because you ban the phrase doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist.
Whether it‚Äôs a swastika on a bus in CA or burning of a mosque in FL we can‚Äôt stand idly by when anti-Semitism &amp; hate crimes are on the rise
Here‚Äôs what Trump‚Äôs executive order on climate policy would do:‚¨áÔ∏è Roll back the #CleanPowerPlan‚¨ÜÔ∏è Lift ban on coal mining on public lands
We must defend women‚Äôs reproductive rights and the millions of women who would be left without care if @PPact is defunded. #PinkOut
This should be a clear example to others considering similar ‚Äúbathroom bills‚Äù ‚Äî hatred doesn‚Äôt pay. 
Two things are key in the Trump/Russia investigation: transparency in the system and accountability. 
Born in Michigan but raised in California @SerenaWilliams began playing tennis when she was three. #WomensHistoryMonth 
This EO is short-sighted and harmful to our environment and public health. CA will work to ensure Trump doesn‚Äôt destroy our planet. 
As I said last week we have a long fight ahead of us in regards to health care and we can‚Äôt get complacent. 
@sarahdwire: .@SenKamalaHarris talks with Fatima and Yuleni Avelica of California before a press conference about deportation 
Looking forward to giving the commencement address at my alma mater @HowardU. 
As @JerryBrownGov stated no matter what this administration throws our way CA won‚Äôt back down without a fight. 
A budget is a reflection of our values &amp; should protect the most vulnerable in our society while investing in the future of our country.
As Trump denies the threat of climate change California and our people are tackling this challenge head on.
It‚Äôs up to all of us to continue the fight for equality for our sisters brothers &amp; loved ones in the LGBT community
We need to provide people with access to an attorney if their liberties are at stake. That‚Äôs why I introduced the Access to Counsel Act.
This is sadly not surprising. 
Judge Gorsuch has a history of rulings that directly hurt middle class families consumers women and more. I oppose his nomination.
Gorsuch imposed religious views on employees and has shown outright hostility toward workers.
Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs record shows he puts corporations ahead of the American people.
The nation‚Äôs drug epidemic isn‚Äôt something that discriminates based on race or class. It‚Äôs a pervasive problem we must fix.
I'll remind you that as Jeff Sessions lectures our cities about the law he is facing calls for resignation for lying to Congress.
California won't deny access to public safety public health or public education because of threats from this administration. 
Last week I voted against controversial hunting practices on Alaska‚Äôs national wildlife refuges. 
Blaming each other won‚Äôt solve anything. It‚Äôs time we work together to increase access to affordable health care in this country. 
We must continue to fight in defense of the most vulnerable and voiceless in our society.
President Trump proposed $5.8B cut to the NIH would greatly impact researchers who work every day to find cures and treat diseases.

Yesterday was a victory but we must remain focused. It won‚Äôt be the last time Trump and the GOP try to gut the ACA.
We need to completely overhaul Trump‚Äôs budget to get rid of his disastrous cuts to critical priorities like the @NIH.

Our top prosecutor should be able to honestly and unbiasedly fulfill his duties as Attorney General ‚Äî Sessions can no longer do that.
Weeks ago I said Sessions should recuse himself from the investigation into Russia and Trump‚Äôs campaign. That is no longer enough.
It is clear Attorney General Jeff #Sessions lied under oath about meeting with Russian officials. He must resign immediately.
Women earn about 21% less than white men and the disparities are even more alarming for black women &amp; Latinas. This is simply unacceptable.
This is another clear sign Sessions must recuse himself from an investigation into Russia‚Äôs influence in the White House.

We have a responsibility to the taxpayers and an even greater one to our sense of justice to end the practice of using private prisons.
The truth is private prison contracts only benefit the corporations that run them. So I would recommend following the money.
So here's my question: why is Sessions wasting taxpayer $$ on a system that is both morally wrong and clearly not working?
A study from 2015 found inmates in private prisons were MORE likely to end up back in prison.
Private prisons are a rotten deal for taxpayers and it‚Äôs abhorrent we incentivize corporations to profit off the incarceration of millions. 
Met with constituents yesterday at a community forum. It was great to see so many people who are passionate about politics. 
Take note: I will fight to ensure equality for all students regardless of their gender identity.
It‚Äôs outrageous the administration is saying anyone who might have committed a crime qualifies for deportations.
Today I will be taking an aerial tour to survey the damage &amp; repair work that‚Äôs been done at the Lake Oroville Dam. 
Before Rosa Parks there was Claudette Colvin. Learn more this #BlackHistoryMonth:
Revoking federal protections for transgender students is an appalling decision that targets kids because of who they are. Shameful. 
Born in Los Angeles Issa Rae was the first black female to create and star in an HBO comedy. #BlackHistoryMonth 
It‚Äôs imperative that LGBTQ youth have supportive environments and know that they are not alone. 
Take the survey: Your priorities for the coming weeks and months ‚Üí
Targeting kids because of who they are is shameful. We can't go back on the decades of progress that we‚Äôve made on transgender rights. 
My bill the Access to Counsel Act would guarantee access to legal counsel for refugees and other travelers blocked at U.S. ports of entry.
Yesterday I met with advocates lawyers and families impacted by President Trump‚Äôs Muslim Ban. 
Immigrants make our communities stronger. We must embrace diversity and fight for what diversity has to offer our nation.
My advice to young people: Stay involved in the problems that are facing your community and make your opinions known to those in power.
We can‚Äôt live up to our ideals as a country if we continue to attack our immigrant communities neighbors friends and colleagues.
It will make our communities less safe as indiscriminate enforcement leaves immigrants less likely to report crimes against themselves.
These rules imply all immigrants should be treated as criminals no matter their background or lack of criminal history. It‚Äôs outrageous.
It‚Äôs simple: this plan for mass deportations goes against our values as a nation and will strike fear in our immigrant communities. 
Tell us what your priorities and concerns are for the coming weeks and months ahead: 
.@Ava‚Äôs work on @SelmaMovie led her to become the first black woman to be nominated for Best Director by the Golden Globe Awards in 2014. 
Every decision we make has a profound impact on our country‚Äôs children. From education to protecting the environment it all affects kids.
Whether it‚Äôs helping refugees out financially donating your time and volunteering or being an advocate every little bit helps. 
Happy birthday to my dear friend @repjohnlewis ‚Äî thank you for showing the world what #goodtrouble looks like. 
We have already seen what it looks like when millions of Americans come together and demonstrate who we are. Keep it up.
Eliminating protections that keep millions of young people on their family health plan until age 26 would be devastating. #SaveACA
The rise of these anti-Semitic threats and hate crimes is deeply disturbing. We all have a responsibility to swiftly denounce them. 
Add your name to denounce the Trump administration‚Äôs targeting of the most vulnerable in our communities:
Mahalia exemplifies a woman with a strong voice who may not be as well known but greatly impacted our nation‚Äôs history. #BlackHistoryMonth
Because of Mahalia‚Äôs urging Dr. King proclaimed he dreams of a nation where children are judged by their character not skin color.
These words shouted by Mahalia Jackson to Dr. King led to him improvising his March on Washington speech. #BlackHistoryMonth 
One month into Trump‚Äôs presidency and we‚Äôve already seen the power of the people. Keep fighting. Keep calling. Keep marching. Action works.
Today is a day to cherish our nation‚Äôs heritage while still looking ahead to the future. Happy #PresidentsDay! 
As California‚Äôs Attorney General I know what a crime looks like. Let me tell you that an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal.
In San Francisco black mothers are more than six times as likely to lose their baby as white mothers. 
I am concerned about the future but more resolved than ever to take up the fight. Join me ‚Üí 
In 1999 Michelle Howard took command of the USS Rushmore becoming the first black woman to command a @USNavy ship. #BlackHistoryMonth 
It is vital that we all reflect on the lessons from the past so we don‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes in the future. 
Many of these Japanese-Americans lost their homes businesses and possessions while they were detained because of this executive order.
CA had two internment camps including Manzanar where more than 2/3 of the people interned there were American citizens by birth.
Today is the 75th anniversary of the executive order that FDR signed that led to the internment of 120000 people of Japanese ancestry.
Vicky wrote me an open letter on @HerCampus about the #MuslimBan &amp; women's healthcare. Yesterday I responded: 
Frankly Pres. Trump‚Äôs #MuslimBan may as well have been hatched in the basement HQ of ISIS ‚Äî he‚Äôs gifted them a powerful recruiting tool.
Channing Dungey became the first black president of a major broadcast TV network when she was hired to oversee @ABC in Feb. of last year. 
E pluribus unum ‚Äî out of many one. A proud look at a citizenship ceremony:
If you or someone you know is impacted by the flash floods please call your local emergency services number:
A free press is the bedrock of our democracy. We can‚Äôt lose sight of that no matter what the administration is saying.
Trump vowed to protect Americans against Wall Street and must resist Wall Street‚Äôs calls to have @CFPB Director Richard Cordray fired.
In 1997 Violet Palmer became the first female referee in the @NBA. 
Let me be clear: nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing. It‚Äôs vital we differentiate between the two.
The president‚Äôs actions have created deep uncertainty for ‚Äãthese ‚ÄãDACA recipients who are working to become doctors
Until we achieve full representation ‚Äî in politics and everywhere else ‚Äî we are falling short of the ideals of our country.
There is deep uncertainty and pain within our immigrant communities. We must measure up to our ideals as a nation and fight for them. 
All of my colleagues must turn their words into actions. The critical hour is upon us. 
The lack of diversity in this photo is unfortunately no longer astounding. We must do better. 
Pruitt has dedicated his career to undermining the EPA ‚Äî therefore I voted NO. No matter what I will continue to fight for our environment. 
Make no mistake: a #MuslimBan runs counter to our nation‚Äôs ideals and threatens our public safety and security. 
I‚Äôm wholeheartedly opposed to the nomination of Pruitt to the @EPA. It is clear he will not work to protect our air water &amp; land.
Let us not mince words about what this would be: a deportation force designed to break up families and deport millions of people. 
In 1996 President Clinton presented Rosa Parks the Medal of Freedom the highest award given to civilians. #BlackHistoryMonth
Rosa remained involved throughout her life. She served on the Board of Advocates of @PPact &amp; co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute
While oftentimes portrayed as a woman with limited civil rights activism at the time of her arrest Rosa was active in her local @NAACP.
On December 1 1955 Rosa Parks refused to give up her Montgomery bus seat to a white passenger and was promptly arrested. 
Civil rights criminal justice &amp; immigration reform are critical issues that impact people of our state &amp; that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here to fight.
It never hurts to be prepared for the potential upcoming storms on Friday:
What makes us a great nation is our fundamental ideals: freedom of religion &amp; press &amp; a 200-year history as a nation built by immigrants. 
At 4:15 p.m. ET I will be taking to the Senate floor for my maiden speech. Make sure to tune in to @CSPAN.
Our nation is stronger because of the generations of immigrants who came here. I stand with those participating in a #DayWithoutImmigrants.
#BlackHistoryMonth is a time to recognize &amp; celebrate the contributions that black people in this country have made 
Balancing the budget on the backs of seniors is wrong. We can‚Äôt cut Social Security and Medicare that millions of seniors rely on.
It‚Äôs vital there‚Äôs a transparent investigation on Russia and Flynn. AG Sessions must recuse himself from this investigation per DOJ rules. 
‚ÄúI cannot escape the fact that I come to the Senate as a symbol of hope and change‚Äù Carol Moseley Braun said shortly after being sworn in. 
Transparency from oil and mining companies took a hit when Trump scrapped the Dodd-Frank rule on oil extraction.
The more diverse a group of decision makers is the more informed the decision will be. That‚Äôs why diversity on all levels of gov is key.
Good. ‚ÄãConsidering his appalling record this would be a tremendous victory for workers across the country. 
#ICERaids lack transparency spread fear and harm public safety. We‚Äôre better than this. 
DOJ rules are clear: Sessions must recuse himself from any criminal investigation into Flynn. Read for yourself: 
Even before the Oroville Dam emergency it‚Äôs been apparent that we must invest in our neglected infrastructure.
We desperately need leaders in Washington who will stand up to the gun lobby. This crisis is destroying lives and harms our most vulnerable. 
if you agree: Americans deserve a transparent independent investigation into Russia‚Äôs involvement with the Trump camp.
Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman of color to have a leading role on a mainstream television show. #BlackHistoryMonth 
A 23-year-old DREAMer. No criminal record. This is outrageous.
DOJ rules are very clear: Sessions is too close to Trump and Flynn and must recuse himself. Period. No exception.
Any chance at a transparent and trustworthy investigation on Russia and Flynn hinges on the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Flynn‚Äôs resignation as a top national security aide to President Trump has raised more questions than answers. It is deeply troubling.
I discussed my bill the #AccessToCounsel Act with @nbcla this past weekend. Watch now: 
#ToImmigrantsWithLove: California ‚Äãstands with you. California will fight for you. You are not in this alone. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
There are going to be so many important fights over the next 4 years ‚Äî it's up to each of us to stand up and serve as leaders.
No woman should be told she can't make decisions about her own body. When women's rights are under attack we fight back.
‚ÄúWomen have an equal stake in our future and should have an equal voice in our politics.‚Äù
Wishing you and your loved ones a wonderful #ValentinesDay! 
Sign my petition today supporting public hearings and an independent investigation: 
Flynn‚Äôs conversations with Russian officials may have jeopardized national security. The public deserves the truth.
Flynn‚Äôs resignation shows the urgent need for a transparent bipartisan investigation into Russia‚Äôs involvement with the Trump camp.
We have a critical need for upgrading our transportation infrastructure in California.
Maya Angelou born in 1928 overcame many obstacles in her life to become an acclaimed writer and civil rights leader. #BlackHistoryMonth 
Discrimination based on gender identity cuts against who we are as a nation. 
As AG of CA I worked to address elementary school truancy and ensure teachers had the resources to lower elementary school absenteeism.
The situation at the #Oroville Dam is still precarious. Please continue to listen to local law enforcement.
To be clear: I will work with anyone where we can find common purpose on mutual ground but where our values differ I will stand my ground.
If you live near the #Oroville dam please heed law enforcement official announcements. 
Congress must work together to create an economy that works for everyone not just the big banks.
In 2001 Ruth Simmons was sworn in as the 18th president of @BrownUniversity &amp; the first black president of an Ivy League institution. #BHM 
Which books on this list have you read? Tell me any you would add. #ShePersisted
Breaking up families and separating kids from their parents is wrong. We can keep America safe without being callous. We must do better.
#ICERaids across the country have torn mothers apart from their children. The raids lack transparency spread fear &amp; harm public safety.
No one should be exploited because of a lack of knowledge about our nation‚Äôs legal system. 
To me justice is about equal opportunity and fairness. It‚Äôs about ensuring all citizens can achieve success and security through hard work.
As CA‚Äôs Attorney General I worked to implement body cameras for hundreds of law enforcement officers.
Families working 40 hours a week should not live in poverty. This is about our American values of respecting and honoring hard work.
By the fourth grade Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell knew she wanted to be a fighter pilot. #BlackHistoryMonth 
This is outrageous ‚ÄîMarathon Pharmaceuticals is charging 70x the cost overseas. When drug companies put profits over lives everyone loses. 
There are times when we don‚Äôt achieve our goals but that‚Äôs not a reason to give up. We must keep fighting.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act 20M more adults have health insurance. We must continue that progress. 
Add your name to ‚Äúcitizen co-sponsor‚Äù my first piece of legislation the Access to Counsel Act.
Ruby Bridges was just 6 when she became the first black child to integrate an all-white public elementary school in Louisiana in 1960. #BHM 
Here‚Äôs the bottom line: detention without access to representation goes against the fundamental values of our judicial system.
This is the moment in time to look in the mirror with furrowed brow to ask that question‚Äî‚Äòwho are we?‚Äô I believe the answer is a good one.
Many of you have asked what you can do to make a difference right now. Help refugees with microresistance acts: 
if you‚Äôre ready to speak truth to power and fight for the voiceless and vulnerable in our society.
Scheduling votes in the middle of the night to conceal the process from Americans is wrong. We need more transparency not less.
Last night the Senate voted to confirm Rep. Price to head @HHSGov. I voted NO because we need someone who will #SaveACA not dismantle it. 
We must redouble our efforts to fight Trump's radical agenda and support those who have the courage to speak up and resist.
In 1980 Ursula Burns joined Xerox as a summer intern worked her way up and was named CEO in 2009. #BlackHistoryMonth 
Trump‚Äôs reckless pursuit of this #MuslimBan has jeopardized our national security and undermined our nation‚Äôs core values.
Our diversity is our strength. It's what makes America special. I'm appalled at this administration's hostility to our fundamental values. 
Asking taxpayers to pay for an unrealistic and expensive border wall is a terrible idea. We need comprehensive immigration reform now. 
‚ÄúKamala Harris‚Äô first bill in the Senate‚Ä¶[is] a strong bill and the Senate shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to take it up.‚Äù
The 9th Circuit Court has denied Trump‚Äôs appeal to reinstate the #MuslimBan. Fight is not over but this is a great victory for our values.
America‚Äôs lack of a national paid family leave policy means families must choose between caring for a loved one or putting food on the table
No matter who you are whether young or old rich or poor gay or straight ‚Äî you deserve justice and equality.
Ibtihaj Muhammad represented @TeamUSA in the Olympics bringing home gold for our country. We cannot stand for this for her or anyone else. 
@SenatorCarper: Proud to co-sponsor this important bill spearheaded by my colleague @KamalaHarris 
@ACLU: Sen. Harris‚Äô 1st bill seeks legal counsel for refugees 
The Access to Legal Counsel Act is one step to ensuring what happened at ports of entry after the executive order never happens again.
After Trump‚Äôs Muslim Ban I received reports of refugees green-card holders &amp; US citizens being held without access to lawyers.
This bill would guarantee refugees immigrants &amp; other travelers who are held or detained at U.S. ports of entry have access to counsel.
Today I‚Äôm introducing my first bill to Congress the Access to Legal Counsel Act. 
I‚Äôve defended CA‚Äôs landmark climate change law from challenges by the biggest polluters and I‚Äôll also use that same fight to #DefendEPA.

In the Senate I‚Äôm working to protect consumers from predatory industries combat climate change and advance criminal justice reform.
Appalled Sessions has been confirmed but we cannot and will not give up on the cause of civil rights. I will fight for you. 
I‚Äôm talking with my colleagues to vote NO on Sessions but I need your help. Call your Senators at (202) 224-3121.
Misty Copeland raised in CA began her ballet studies at age 13 &amp; later became the first black woman to perform the lead in Swan Lake. #BHM 
The gains that our country has made are not permanent. It is incumbent on the Attorney General to fight for the rights of all our people.
You deserve an Attorney General who recognizes the full human equality of ALL our people. #HoldTheFloor
What makes us right and great as a county are our values and ideals rooted in justice and equality. #HoldTheFloor
In short: to the vast majority of Americans who need an advocate for justice and equality Senator Session has not been your advocate.
Sen. Sessions voted no when both Democrats and Republicans came together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.  #HoldTheFloor
Sen. Sessions voted to gut the Voting Rights Act and then called the @NAACP ‚Äúun-American.‚Äù #HoldTheFloor
It is the DOJ that addresses systemic inequalities that exist in our system but it is Senator Sessions who fought against reform.
This is not a debate about a president‚Äôs nominee ‚Äî it is a debate about the fundamental values of our country.
A harm against one of us is a harm against all of us ‚Äî as a civil society we can‚Äôt let the voiceless fight alone. #HoldTheFloor
The DOJ must be able to ensure fair and impartial justice for all Americans. That best articulates the spirit behind our judicial system.
If SCOTUS had not ruled the way they did in Brown v. Board of Education I wouldn‚Äôt be standing here in the U.S. Senate. #HoldTheFloor
I like to joke my sister and I grew up surrounded by adults who spent their full time marching and shouting for this thing called justice.
.@SenateDems are continuing to #HoldTheFloor to oppose Sen. Sessions' nomination as AG. I'll be speaking soon. Watch on @CSPAN.
The Senate is voting on Sessions‚Äô nomination for AG tonight. We have a moral obligation to defeat him. Call your Senators at (202) 224-3121.

now if you believe it is wrong for the GOP to silence @SenWarren for trying to read a letter from Coretta Scott King. #LetLizSpeak
It is demeaning to the memory of Coretta Scott King and harmful to the process for the Republicans to silence @SenWarren. #LetLizSpeak
The suggestion that reciting the words of the great Coretta Scott King by @SenWarren is an attack on a Senator is outrageous. #LetHerSpeak
I applaud Shelia Fedrick for her quick thinking and action to save a girl on her flight from human trafficking. #endtrafficking

Thirty-one years after America first launched a man into space Dr. Mae Jemison became the first black woman to go into space.

Want to make a difference in the fight to save our schools? My advice: run for school board attend PTA meetings get into #goodtrouble.
If you called wrote organized and got involved in the fight to defeat DeVos don‚Äôt give up. We need your voice now more than ever.
I voted NO on DeVos‚Äô nomination and am disappointed we fell short. We must fight to ensure our kids have access to a first-rate education.
CA has over 6 million children in our public schools. There‚Äôs too much at stake not to fight for our education system. #NoOnDeVos
"@womensmarch: ""It is clear from her testimony Betsy DeVos has not done her homework."" ‚Äî@KamalaHarris #DumpDeVos "
Yesterday I took to the floor of the Senate joining my colleagues to #HoldTheFloor in opposition to DeVos‚Äô nomination. 
Climate change is a scientific fact. Just because the administration wants to ignore it won't make it go away.
CA deserves clean air and clean water. We need someone to head the EPA who will work with us not against us.
Simply put: it is clear that Betsy DeVos has not done her homework in preparing for the job and we must refuse to confirm her. #HoldTheFloor
DeVos cannot and will not uphold the law if she does not understand the law. #HoldTheFloor
There is a clear connection between public education and public safety. We must recognize that. #HoldTheFloor #StopDeVos
Fewer teachers fewer resources less aid to make college affordable. That is unacceptable. #HoldTheFloor
Half a million teachers would be put out of work under the Trump-DeVos plan. Devastating for our six million CA students. #HoldTheFloor
Even Eli Broad a supporter of dramatic education reforms has expressed strong concerns about DeVos‚Äô nomination. #HoldTheFloor
There is no question ending campus sexual assault should be a moral imperative and priority for the Secretary of Education. #HoldtheFloor
At best DeVos showed ambivalence toward gun-free school zones. #HoldTheFloor
First and foremost the country needs a Sec. of Education who has demonstrated basic competency when it comes to issues facing children.
Surely we can agree that every child in the U.S. should have access to a quality education so they can get a good job that pays well.
In case you haven‚Äôt heard it today: Your culture is important and your story matters. 
.@SenateDems are holding the floor for 24hrs‚Äã straight‚Äã to oppose‚Äã ‚ÄãBetsy‚Äã ‚ÄãDeVos. I'll join them at 8 pm ET. Watch on @CSPAN.

Opposing DAPL is about protecting the water we drink and leaving our children a sustainable future. #noDAPL
The latest executive order allows banks take advantage of hardworking American families. It‚Äôs disgraceful. 
We can‚Äôt go back on the progress that we‚Äôve made. Clean air and water are essential to healthy communities and a sustainable economy.
It is clear Pruitt will work to roll back environmental protections and side with corporations and polluters instead of working families.
During his hearing Pruitt failed to say if he would uphold California‚Äôs motor vehicle pollution standards which is unacceptable.
If Attorney General Pruitt is confirmed as the head of the @EPA our air water and land will be endangered. Therefore I will vote no.
We must choose hope over hate; action over apathy.
Never forget that you have a powerful voice that is capable of inspiring great change. 
‚ÄúGirls like Elena should prick our conscience when we turn our backs on them. Watch Elena‚Äôs story.‚Äù

I applaud Judge Robart appointed by President Bush for taking bold action to halt the #MuslimBan. 
.@PPact has provided millions of women &amp; men across the country vital access to reproductive health care. 
Because of the Affordable Care Act more than 20M Americans have health insurance. I will fight efforts to repeal.
If you‚Äôve ever wondered what you would have done during the Civil Rights Movement this is your opportunity to find out. #goodtrouble
Congress must take action and think about the best interests of Americans and our troops.
That‚Äôs why my colleagues &amp; I introduced legislation that would clarify the membership of the Nat'l Security Council
The decision to elevate Bannon to a permanent member of the NSC and demote intelligence/military experts sets a dangerous precedent.

This is irresponsible. We are repeating the same mistakes that created the 2008 financial crisis. 
It‚Äôs critical we expand early voting so everyone has ample opportunity to vote &amp; stop discriminatory voting laws. #BlackHistoryMonth
Instead of suppressing votes we have to make it easier for everyone to vote &amp; zealously protect access to the ballot box for all Americans.
Voting is fundamental to our democratic society yet the GOP at all levels are working to deny the franchise instead of protecting the vote.
Today in 1870 the 15th Amendment was ratified granting black men the right to vote. This was just the start in the fight for voting rights
Since becoming POTUS Trump has threatened healthcare for millions in CA and threatened national security with his #MuslimBan.
Frederick Douglass born into slavery in 1818 would later become an abolitionist author and civil rights activist. #BlackHistoryMonth

We have a responsibility to critically evaluate all nominees‚Äô backgrounds to make sure they will fulfill their oath &amp; their responsibility. 
We must not shut our borders to people who are fleeing harm.

This does not make us more safe. 
We must:‚úÖCrush the student debt cycle‚úÖCreate pathways to free tuition at public colleges and universities
Betsy DeVos is a threat to our children‚Äôs future which is why I will vote no on her nomination. 
Sessions will not be an advocate for the voiceless and vulnerable. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm urging my colleagues to vote no on Sessions for AG.
Let us aspire to create a just society for the next gen whether they will know our names or not. #BlackHistoryMonth
This is not who we are. We‚Äôre better than this. 
It‚Äôs vital any member of the Supreme Court think of their rulings not just in a theoretical way but how laws can affect real people. 
President Trump‚Äôs executive order uprooted lives and is a threat to our national security economy and jobs. 
I voted against Rex Tillerson's nomination. We need a Secretary of State who will put America's national security first. 
Sorry we missed your call @SaraBareilles ‚Äî rest assured I‚Äôm opposing both Betsy DeVos and Jeff Sessions. Keep calling. Stay engaged! 
When immigrants report fewer crimes because they‚Äôre afraid of the police it makes all of us unsafe.  
‚ÄúPlease tell Mr. Trump when they make these kind of decisions think it all the way through.‚Äù
This past week we asked you to tell us why you oppose President Trump‚Äôs #MuslimBan and almost 2000 people shared their story. #NoBanNoWall

I am troubled by the nomination of Judge Gorsuch and will fight to ensure the voice of the American people is heard in this process.
It‚Äôs appalling that those detained at airports were not given access to the legal representation they deserve.

Add your name if you agree we need to give each child a fair shot at success in school and in life: 
During her hearing DeVos did not show she‚Äôd be committed to enforcing the Individuals with Disabilities Act which is critical.
She refused to say she‚Äôd keep public funding for schools intact and showed she wouldn‚Äôt act in the best interests of our public schools.
DeVos has repeatedly failed to show she is qualified to handle the most basic issues facing students.
Providing our children with a quality education is of utmost importance and I‚Äôve determined she will not serve the needs of our children.
Betsy DeVos is a threat to our children‚Äôs future which is why I will vote no on her nomination.
I‚Äôm incredibly relieved that Areej Ali was able to be reunited with her family at the @flyLAXairport. 
A vote for Sessions is a vote to defend the #MuslimBan. We have a moral obligation to defeat him. Add your name: 
History will look favorably on Sally Yates who stood up for what she felt was right in opposition to the Trump administration's #MuslimBan.
It is clear that the resistance to Trump‚Äôs radical agenda will be led by courageous women fighting for our future. 
Trump should listen to AG Yates and the voices of Americans across the country by rescinding his #MuslimBan. 
Proud of the hard work of the lawyers who are camped out in airports across the country. They‚Äôre on the front lines &amp; it is truly inspiring. 
The text and intent in the President‚Äôs executive order leaves no question ‚Äî it is a Muslim ban. 
Executive action that denies entry to those fleeing violence while putting one religion over another is unconscionable and unconstitutional.
As a nation of immigrants this #MuslimBan runs counter to what truly makes America great: our diversity and our compassion.
Proud to work w/ @PattyMurray to author a letter to @POTUS demanding he revoke the EO targeting refugees. #NoBanNoWall
Right now I‚Äôm joining w/ my fellow Dems on the steps of the Supreme Court to protest Trump‚Äôs #MuslimBan. Watch: 
Tomorrow is the last day to enroll in the Affordable Care Act. Go to  to get covered.
As Coretta Scott King taught us the fight for civil rights‚Äîthe struggle for justice and equality‚Äîmust be fought &amp; won with each generation. 
This poem by Emma Lazarus rests at the base of the Statue of Liberty and is a reminder of who we really are: 
At least he‚Äôs finally admitting what we already know: this is a #MuslimBan. 
My heart goes out to victims and the families of the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre shooting. 
Trump should listen to the voices of those rising up across the country and cancel these bigoted executive orders targeting refugees. 
We will not stand for this. #NoBanNoWall
I‚Äôve also been in touch with Muslim community leaders and I‚Äôm carefully monitoring the detainment issues that have arisen in CA airports.
Yesterday evening I also spoke on the phone with Secretary Kelly and told him this Executive Order goes against our American values.
This violates the federal court orders and it is imperative he ensures all staff are notified and comply with the law.
I have received reports from attorneys in CA that agents are continuing to deny or delay entry to America to visa holders and others.
Today I sent a letter to @DHSgov Sec Kelly urging him to immediately allow individuals detained to have timely access to legal counsel.
I repeat: This IS a Muslim ban no matter how @POTUS tries to spin his way out of the mess he has created. #NoBanNoWall 
Here‚Äôs the truth: democracy is not a spectator sport. Raise your voice and say #NoBanNoWall. 
Let‚Äôs rise up together just as Americans have done in generations past to fight for the cause of justice and equality for all people. 
We will fight against racism. We will fight against anti-Muslim rhetoric. We will fight against those who will marginalize who we are. 
To immigrants and refugees being targeted by Trump:You are not alone.We are fighting for you.We will not abandon you.Don‚Äôt give up. 
Say it loud say it clear everyone is welcome here. #NoBanNoWall 
Outside the WH to stand in solidarity w/ refugees and immigrants who are being targeted by this admin. This is not who we are. #NoBanNoWall 
Turning our backs on refugees is one of the dark moments in American history. One we must rise to meet b/c this is only the beginning.
Together we can fight for and win back our democracy. Join us at the White House at 1pm to protest the #MuslimBan. Let‚Äôs raise our voices.
Refugees don't make us less safe; they enrich our communities. We can‚Äôt turn our backs on them.
Thank you @ACLU! Temporary victory but it‚Äôs not over yet. The fight to defeat this #MuslimBan continues. 
This woman was about to become a U.S. citizen in two weeks. Two weeks. And because of Trump‚Äôs executive orders she may not be able to. 
In 2016 the uninsured rate in California reached a historic low of 7.4%. We can‚Äôt go back to the way things were. 
I stand in solidarity with those protesting the #MuslimBan at JFK and across the country. We‚Äôre stronger when we raise our voices together. 
Turning our backs on millions of refugees is a dark moment in American history. We have abandoned our moral leadership on the world stage. 
To our brothers sisters and friends in immigrant and refugees communities at home and all across the world ‚Äî know that you are not alone.
From LA to DC we‚Äôve shown the administration that the power of this country does not rest in the White House it belongs to the people.
Make no mistake ‚Äî President Trump‚Äôs executive orders is a Muslim ban and it‚Äôll most affect women and children displaced by violence.
We can learn a lot from six-year-old Alex.
We know so goes California so goes the rest of the nation. The nation is looking at us for leadership. It‚Äôs time to buckle up and fight.
We need to build trust between immigrant communities and our law enforcement not weaken it. 
This was just the first week under the new admin but I know I‚Äôm going to need your help in the coming weeks &amp; years: 
Every woman deserves safe affordable access to comprehensive reproductive health care ‚Äî including abortion.
During the Holocaust we failed to let refugees like Anne Frank into our country. We can't let history repeat itself.
We can't turn our backs on the millions of refugees who are contributing to our country and our economy.
We have opened our doors to those fleeing violence and oppression for decades by presidents on both sides of the aisle.
On #HolocaustMemorialDay Trump restricted refugees from Muslim-majority countries. Make no mistake ‚Äî this is a Muslim ban.
When folks come up to me and ask me to tell them about women‚Äôs issues I say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so glad you want to talk about the economy.‚Äô 
@AuschwitzMuseum: 72 years ago today over 7000 prisoners of Auschwitz were liberated by the Soviet army  #Holoca‚Ä¶
Women lose tens of thousands of dollars a year to the gender wage gap‚Äî$ that should be going toward paying their rent or buying necessities.
This week I voted against the nomination of Rep. Pompeo questioned Rep. Mulvaney and said I‚Äôd defend women and immigrants.
Thank you @jaketapper ‚Äî the free press is a bedrock of our democracy. 
The admin may be pulling the plug on Affordable Care Act ads but I wanted you to know the last day to sign up is January 31st. 
No child should ever live with the fear that hatred will tear their families apart. 
Science is fact and a critical part of our society that helps us create a better future for our children.
The vast majority of undocumented immigrants are following the law working hard paying taxes ‚Äî and we have to provide a pathway for them.
Here‚Äôs how: expand early voting modernize voter registration systems and strengthen protections against discriminatory voting laws.
Suppressing voters goes against the fundamentals of our democratic society. We must make it easier for citizens to vote ‚Äî not harder.
We can‚Äôt play politics after a natural disaster hits California or any other part of the country. 
#TBT to the @womensmarch last weekend. We must continue the movement we started there and get involved in our local communities. 
Trump‚Äôs executive orders on immigration today will tear apart families at the direct expense of public safety and national security.
Any attempt by this admin to attack voting rights should be met with intense opposition from both political parties. This is not who we are.
For those struggling with student loans &amp; financial pressure Affordable Care Act benefits help ensure they have one less worry in life. 
The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice ‚Äî it is our responsibility to continue MLK‚Äôs work and bend it ourselves.
You can bet I‚Äôll be on the frontlines of this fight. I've defended immigrant communities before ‚Äî and I'm prepared to do it again.
To our brothers sisters and friends in our immigrant communities: please know today that you are not alone.
CA is home to more immigrants ‚Äî documented and undocumented ‚Äî than any state. We benefit from their creativity &amp; love of our country.
Forcing taxpayers to pay for a wall isn‚Äôt a solution it‚Äôs a band-aid on the larger need for comprehensive immigration reform.
Executive orders to break up families in California by this administration will harm public safety and jeopardize our national security.
About one in five women and men report being the victims of sexual assault while in college. This is a travesty. 
In his first week Trump has targeted women people of color immigrants transparency and our values. That's not populist. It's just wrong.
Never forget that you have a powerful voice. Raise your voice ‚Üí call your members of Congress at (202) 224-3121.
Like @JerryBrownGov said yesterday California will not turn its back on the progress made on immigration health care or climate change. 
Torture is both ineffective and inconsistent with our values as Americans. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain. 
Tell Republicans that we will not let them get away with gutting funding for Planned Parenthood:
Here's the truth: infrastructure spending isn't a transportation issue for most Americans ‚Äî it's a human rights issue.
We must appeal to our better selves instead of our lesser instincts. Let‚Äôs fight for equality fight for fairness and fight for justice.
If we are going to be faithful to our ideals as a country then we also have to be committed to everyone‚Äôs health. 
This administration is launching direct attacks on truth and transparency in our gov‚Äôt. Very troubling -- and honestly anti-democratic. 
Ricardo was brought to the US when he was four. Now he‚Äôs in law school so he can become a prosecutor &amp; fight crime. 
Instead of projects that only benefit Big Oil execs we should protect local water supplies &amp; develop new clean energy. We must fight back. 
CA will lose more than 334000 jobs if GOP repeals the Affordable Care Act. It's despicable they are jeopardizing our economic security.
From the bottom of my heart thank you. I look forward to fighting for justice with you by my side. 
Add your name in defense of @PPact who‚Äôs being attacked by those who want to restrict a woman‚Äôs right to choose. 
Pompeo‚Äôs record on torture surveillance &amp; metadata are inconsistent w/ our national security interests and values. That‚Äôs why I voted no.
Congratulations @XavierBecerra on your confirmation! I know CA will continue to have a fearless leader working for them as Attorney General. 
Millions of people across the country are relying on us to stop the Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act. 
You cannot effect change if you sit on the sidelines waiting for someone else to solve the problems facing your community.
This group just made it more difficult for women to get access to health care worldwide. You tell me what's wrong with this picture. 
Outraged but not surprised one of Trump's first moves denies women lifesaving healthcare services. #GlobalGagRule 
Our immigrant communities represent the heart and soul of what it means to be an American.
Thank you to everyone joining our movement via #mutemonday today. Let's work together to choose hope not hate; action not apathy.
The #WomensMarch was just the beginning. Here are a few ways to take action in your own communities now:  
Block grant is nothing more than code for radical cuts to health insurance programs that benefit the most vulnerable among us. 
In our system of democracy in our system of justice we must decide that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.
Let's buckle in b/c the next 4 years will be a bumpy ride. It will get harder before it gets easier but I know we will rise to the challenge
Thank you Lisa for sharing your story. I will do everything in my power to fight for you. 
THIS is what democracy looks like: 
If you‚Äôre fired up after the #womensmarch and #ReadytoRun check out @EmilysList resources to get you started:
Even if you're not sitting in the White House even if you don't run a big corporate super PAC ‚Äî you have the power. 
Let‚Äôs do what is necessary to unite as a country find common ground and tackle the reforms we need right now.
Yesterday showed that the American people have a very powerful voice ‚Äì we're activated and we must be taken seriously.
I‚Äôm #7in10forRoe because we must ensure that women are empowered to make their own choices about their bodies.
Our unity is our strength and our diversity is our power. We must remember that in the years ahead. 
Women people of color and all Americans will not retreat when being attacked. We will stand up and we will fight. 
The #WomensMarch is not the end rather this is just the beginning of a movement. We must recommit ourselves to getting involved at home.
Thank you to everyone who came out to the @WomensMarch yesterday! We are stronger when we raise our voices together. 
Today‚Äôs @WomensMarch really made me believe in the possibilities of our country with people of all backgrounds united for justice. 
They can take the House Senate and White House but they cannot take away our power. What an extraordinary day. #WomensMarch 
#IMarchFor a more perfect union where the law finally guarantees women equal pay for equal work no matter their race.
#IMarchFor women‚Äôs reproductive rights and the millions of women who would be left without care if @PPact is defunded. #WomensMarch
"@HuffPostWomen: ""I know one thing. Even if you're not sitting in The White House... you have the power."" - @KamalaHarris #WomensMarch ht‚Ä¶"
#IMarchFor the people of California who may feel frustrated by lawmakers in Washington who are trying to revert back to the 1950‚Äôs. 
You want to talk about women‚Äôs issues? That‚Äôs fantastic. Let‚Äôs talk about health care education climate change and more. #WomensMarch 
"@CBSNews: ""Let's make today a beginning"" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) says at #WomensMarch. ""Let's buckle in because it's going to be a b‚Ä¶"
"@cnnbrk: Sen. Kamala Harris speaks at the #WomensMarch: ""We the people have the power""  "
We as women -- together -- are powerful and we are a force that cannot be dismissed or written off into the sidelines #WomensMarch
If you‚Äôre a woman who is an immigrant and you don‚Äôt want your family torn apart you know immigration reform is a women‚Äôs issue #WomensMarch
There is nothing more powerful than a group of determined sisters marching #WomensMarch
Part of what makes us great is we are a nation founded on certain ideals that were spoken in 1776 -- that we are all equal  #WomensMarch
This is an extraordinary day and we should all be extremely proud  #WomensMarch
#IMarchFor every woman man and child who have ever felt like their voices were silenced. #WomensMarch
Tell me what or who you march for today. #IMarchFor_______________. #WomensMarch
The GOP want to deny the franchise instead of protecting the vote. They want to go back on civil rights &amp; voting rights. We won‚Äôt let them.
Fighting for everyone to have access to health care is fundamentally about fighting for the best we could be as a country. 
The Republicans may have taken an election but they did not take our power. We are not defeated and we won't give up. 
#IMarchFor the women that came before us &amp; those that follow in our footsteps. The new administration must know that we will not be silent.
#IMarchFor our immigrant and LGBTQ communities who are still not treated equally in the eyes of the law.
#IMarchFor the Americans who feel like they can‚Äôt speak up when they‚Äôre sexually assaulted.
#IMarchFor the women who are being silenced for their right to choose and access to comprehensive reproductive health care.
#IMarchFor the women who aren't paid equally. #WomensMarch
This is why I will be marching. #IMarchFor women of color who are marginalized across the country especially at the ballot box.
The US was founded on the ideals spoken in 1776 that we are all and should be treated as equals. In 2017 those ideals have not been met.
Tomorrow I will be speaking and participating in the @WomensMarch on Washington in Washington D.C. I‚Äôm excited to join this movement.
We were founded on ideals that say that there will be freedom of religion freedom of association &amp; that we will respect the dignity of all.
For ethical and moral reasons we have to honor our promise made by the US government to DREAMers.
It is the very nature of this fight that whatever gains we make they will not be permanent. The same is true of our opponents.
@emilyslist: .@KamalaHarris will not stop fighting for the ideals and values that make our country strong. #WontBackDown 
I will do everything in my power to defend Roe v. Wade and ensure that women can make their own choices about their bodies.
CA has the largest number of immigrants both documented and undocumented in the US ‚Äî and I will fight for them. We are stronger together.
As Coretta Scott King said the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation. It‚Äôs time for our generation to rise up.
if you‚Äôll fight for a country that is rooted in justice equality tolerance and fairness.
So here‚Äôs the deal: our ideals are at stake right now and we will have to fight for who we are. Our work is just beginning.
We must not despair. We must not be overwhelmed or throw up our hands. It is time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are.
We must not remain silent in a time that requires us to be louder than ever ‚Üí louder about civil rights women‚Äôs rights &amp; immigration.
The GOP‚Äôs attacks on @PPact &amp; women‚Äôs access to abortion are reprehensible. It‚Äôs up to us to build a coalition of people who will stop them.
Let us all stand up for people who deserve to have access health care and want to live a healthy life for themselves and their children. 
Thank you @BarackObama for giving these Californians a second chance &amp; letting them become contributing members of their communities again 
ICYMI: Yesterday I questioned President-elect Trump‚Äôs nominee to head the @EPA Scott Pruitt. Read more ‚Üí
if you believe we must continue @BarackObama‚Äôs fight and ensure that the progress we made under his leadership isn‚Äôt lost. #ThanksObama
We have an ethical and moral obligation to ensure they don‚Äôt live their life in fear. If you agree add your name:
The United States was founded by immigrants and no state has benefited more from their creativity and love of our country than California.
General Kelly has failed to provide assurance that DREAMers will not be deported which is why I cannot support his nomination.
On President @BarackObama‚Äôs last full day in office I wanted to thank him for everything that he‚Äôs done for our country. #ThankYouObama 
Women should not have to worry about politicians‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoften male politicians‚Ää‚Äîgetting rid of their access to quality &amp; affordable health care.
According to the @USCBO repealing the ACA would:‚ÜíCost 18M people their insurance‚ÜíCause individual insurance premiums to double over time
We must allow women not lawmakers to make their own choices about their body ‚Äî period. 
Now more than ever we need to restore truth transparency and trust to our criminal justice system.
This is incredibly alarming. As we've seen in Flint MI exposure to lead can be deadly and it's vital the head of the EPA knows that. 
Thank you @MichelleObama for showing the world that women of color can be bosses leaders and activists.
I will firmly oppose any efforts by the GOP to weaken the Endangered Species Act. We must protect our animals. 
Inaction over the next 4 years will be disastrous for our children‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs alarming how many of Trump‚Äôs appointees deny this crisis. 
Except for in the hands of school officers guns do not belong in our schools. DeVos thinking otherwise is dangerous for our students.
If you are a victim of domestic violence you can be denied health care because that‚Äôs considered a pre-existing condition. That‚Äôs wrong. 
Baseball fan Pruitt lost 6 of 7 lawsuits against the EPA. That would be a mediocre .142 batting average.
Scott Pruitt will not say whether he will agree to upholding California's high vehicle pollution standards. That is unacceptable.
Tune in to @CSPAN for Scott Pruitt's hearing. I will be questioning him. It's critical the next head of the EPA protects our land and water.
As Attorney General I took on the big banks engaged in predatory lending practices for-profit diploma mills and big polluters.
The Affordable Care Act has ensured that the 129 million Americans who have pre-existing conditions have access to affordable care. 
For Sharoni Little from Compton President Obama showed her 2 sons that there are no limits to what they can achieve
@WhiteHouse: BREAKING: With 209 commutations and 64 pardons @POTUS just gave 273 Americans a second chance. Learn more ‚Üí 
Thank you @LorettaLynch for your service to our nation and being an example to  African-American women everywhere.
Call the Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121 and they can connect you to your Senator or House representative. #SaveACA #OurFirstStand
This is appalling. We can‚Äôt leave 18M people behind without access to health care. Call your representatives telling them to #SaveACA. 
On Sunday I joined my colleagues across the country in speaking up about the importance of protecting the Affordable Care Act. #SaveACA 
We can no longer afford to ignore our incarceration problem ‚Äî the financial and societal costs for victims and taxpayers are too high.
We‚Äôre fighting for the 129 million Americans who no longer can be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. #SaveACA 
Every day our struggle continues but we fight on. #goodtrouble 
It is unacceptable to attack communities of color &amp; outright immoral to deport millions of people who have known no other home than the U.S.
We must all speak up and speak out. Now is the time to raise your voice. 
The struggle may be long and the road may be difficult but with organized action and a clear heart we shall overcome. 
We must continue his pursuit for freedom and speak truth to power ‚Äî especially in the face of bullying or violence from our opposition.
And the courage and compassion he showed in the face of violence during the March from Selma to Montgomery was inspirational to us all.
His work to organize the March on Washington and as head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was groundbreaking and impactful.
I would like to take a moment today to also celebrate John Lewis who has repeatedly shown us the value of getting into ‚Äúgood trouble.‚Äù
Do not underestimate your power. Stay engaged. Fight on.
Where we stand in times of challenge and controversy defines us more than where we stand in times of comfort and convenience. #MLKDay 
As a prosecutor I advocated for CA‚Äôs immigrant communities and immigration reform. I‚Äôm  continuing that work today.
Good news! More than 40% of CA has emerged from a punishing drought. 
@eqca: Today we joined @KamalaHarris @healthaccess CA Sup. @HildaSolis and thousands of community members to support the #ACA. #Fight‚Ä¶
We must #SaveACA. 
Allowing young people the opportunity to stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26 is a smart &amp; sensible solution. 
@mayajanew17: Thank you for inspiring me and so many others (and for being so nice to me üòÇ) @KamalaHarris #OurFirstStand #SaveACA 
Sign my petition now if you agree it is morally wrong for the GOP to repeal the Affordable Care Act:  #OurFirstStand
"""Knowing I have affordable health care is the only thing keeping me going.‚Äù ‚ÄîSteve Martin ACA beneficiary #OurFirstStand "

"""This is America. We cannot call ourselves a first world country without health care for all.‚Äù - Sherry ACA Beneficiary #OurFirstStand "
Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years since the Affordable Care Act became law. #OurFirstStand
This debate is not about statistics or dollar signs it is about real people with real stories who are counting on all of us. #OurFirstStand 
GOP leaders should do what the majority of Americans want: work w/ Dems to advance commonsense reforms to improve the law. #OurFirstStand
It would be a national disgrace if our country stripped health benefits away from the most vulnerable among us. #OurFirstStand
Fired up and ready to talk about why we must save the Affordable Care Act. Millions of lives are at stake in this fight. #OurFirstStand 
Earlier this week I asked people to share their #SaveACA stories. The following are just a glimpse at how Americans are feeling. 
Before the ACA was enacted as many as 129M Americans could be denied coverage or charged higher rates for their pre-existing conditions. 
Communities across California are joining the front lines in the fight to protect DREAMers. We must protect them.
We cannot go back to the way things were before the Affordable Care Act. Millions of lives are at stake. 
Join me at a rally tomorrow to tell Republicans loudly &amp; clearly that they cannot take health care away.
This week was action packed from calling out the GOP over health care to questioning cabinet appointees.  
The way our system deals with low-level nonviolent and non-serious offenders wastes resources needed to fight more serious crime.
If you agree please add your name to our petition calling on my Senate colleagues to oppose Sessions as well: 
It is clear after his confirmation hearings that person is not Jeff Sessions and that is why I oppose his confirmation as AG.
We need an Attorney General committed to equal rights for all including women people of color and the LGBT community.
I have deep concerns about Jeff Sessions ability to defend the rights of all Americans -- I will be voting against his confirmation.
Republicans want to throw nearly 30 million people off of health insurance. We can‚Äôt let that happen. 
John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this. 
You have given me the responsibility to defend the vulnerable in our society from those who will do them harm. I don‚Äôt take this lightly.
Supporting early literacy is crucial as seen by Daliyah‚Äôs story.
Stripping away insurance from millions of Americans goes against our values. We must not be silent. We must not back down. 
Earlier this week I questioned Gen. Kelly about what immigrant youth should expect from the Trump administration. 
Congratulations Vice President Joe Biden on the Presidential Medal of Freedom ‚Äî your service to this nation is relentless and unwavering. 
I eat ‚Äòno‚Äô for breakfast and I‚Äôve never been a fan of the word ‚Äòcan‚Äôt‚Äô ‚Äî aimed at me or anyone else.
Two years ago today we launched this journey and I am grateful for your role in our victory. 
Yesterday the BRIDGE Act which I co-sponsored was reintroduced in the Senate. We must ensure DREAMers have temp. relief from deportation.
In 2009 I launched the Teen Dating Violence Public Education Campaign to raise awareness among H.S. students about how to seek help.
Heroes don‚Äôt always wear capes ‚Äî sometimes they wear judicial robes. 
.@BarackObama's expansion of the CA Coastal National Monument will ensure it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
Repealing and replacing the ACA without fully looking at the consequences would be a disservice to people in similar situations as Rachel. 
No family should have to choose between life-saving medication or putting food on the table. We must address the cost of prescription drugs.
Relieving the debt burden of thousands of students who attended fraudulent for-profit colleges is vital. 
Our current CIA director understands this and it's critical that the next director does as well.
Climate change is a direct threat to our democracy. We need someone that understands the impact climate change has on global instability. 
Before the ACA was enacted 2.3M young Americans didn‚Äôt have health coverage. Now they can stay on their parents‚Äô plans until they turn 26.
#TBT to the 2016 San Francisco Pride Parade. I‚Äôve been unequivocal in my support and won‚Äôt stop fighting until all people have equal rights. 
Tune in to @CSPAN to watch the nomination hearing for Rep Mike Pompeo for CIA Director. I will be involved in questioning him.
We must make our health care system work for everyone not just the pharmaceutical companies.
I want to hear from you. Tweet me your stories about why you believe we should #SaveACA.
We‚Äôve got to stop playing politics w/public health. This is not a partisan issue. It‚Äôs a crucial conversation about our values as a country.
The Senate vote last night was procedural but it shows exactly where Republicans stand on the Affordable Care Act.
They voted against allowing young people to stay on their parent‚Äôs health insurance plan until they turn 26. #SaveACA
In a series of amendment votes the GOP shut down continued access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. #SaveACA
I voted no on behalf of the 5 million Californians who will be stripped of their right to health care if the ACA is repealed. #SaveACA
In the middle of the night the GOP took the first step towards repealing the ACA. I voted no. #SaveACA
@KamalaHarris: If you or someone you know is in need of assistance due to flooding please contact your county: 
We are at a seminal moment in time for criminal justice policy ‚Äî we can no longer afford to ignore our nation‚Äôs incarceration problem.
Repealing Obamacare would be detrimental to 20M+ Americans. We must improve the law not get rid of it &amp; hope a better option just appears. 
Today is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay which affects all corners of our country. We must dismantle trafficking networks &amp; help survivors.
2.3M young Americans now have health coverage b/c they can stay on their parents‚Äô plans until they turn 26. We can‚Äôt turn our backs on them.
Thank you @BarackObama for everything you‚Äôve done. We‚Äôve come a long way but there‚Äôs still progress to be made. 
Expanding the adoption of body cameras is vital to ensuring we increase transparency &amp; expose any disparities.
CA has $59B in unmet transportation needs in our state. America must be represented by someone who will work to improve our infrastructure.
Our next AG must reinvigorate the vital protections of the Voting Rights Act and ensure all our fundamental rights are protected. 
An oil executive w/deep ties to the Kremlin is alarming. I hope my colleagues question Tillerson on need to put US' national security first.
Russia‚Äôs cyber-attacks pose a threat to our national security and demand a bipartisan response not politics as usual.
Think repealing the ACA won‚Äôt affect you? Think again. Repeal would harm our economy &amp; overall health of our nation.
Thank you Pres. Obama. You‚Äôve made us proud these last 8 years. I cannot thank you &amp; your family enough for your sacrifice to our nation.
.@BarackObama is right: It‚Äôs on us to talk with our friends and neighbors and look out for each other not alienate each other.
I volunteered for the Iowa caucus on behalf of @BarackObama in 2008. A chance encounter there changed my life.
Russian interference in our elections trouble all Americans and I will continue to support a thorough and fact-based investigation.
Russia deliberately attempted to undermine public faith in our democratic process. This is a serious threat to our national security.
Nothing is more important to the preservation of our democracy than the protection of free and fair elections.
I will continue to defend Obamacare in the Senate because everyone deserves access to quality affordable health care. 
@maddow: Genteel confirmation hearing for Gen. John Kelly to helm DHS just took a hard turn -- Sen @KamalaHarris just took him apart on‚Ä¶
Kamala Harris: All victims of crime regardless of their status deserve full and equal protection under the law.
740000 DREAMers grew up pledging allegiance to the only flag they know ‚Äì the American flag. We must work together to #SaveDACA.
Tonight at 6 p.m. PT President @BarackObama will be giving his farewell address. What is your favorite moment from the past 8 years?
During the hearing we will be live-tweeting so stay tuned. I look forward to representing the voices of Californians.
As a member of the Homeland Security Committee I will be tasked with questioning General John F. Kelly which starts at 12:30 p.m. PT.
Each nominee deserves a fair hearing in the Senate but I wanted you to know that my colleagues &amp; I are ready to aggressively engage.
Today marks the beginning of confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump‚Äôs cabinet positions. 
We need an AG who will stand for justice equality &amp; defend the civil rights of all Americans. Sen. Sessions hasn‚Äôt shown he can do that.
Senator Sessions‚Äô support for policies that undermine core DOJ duties is troubling &amp; I hope my colleagues ask tough fair questions.
Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years since the Affordable Care Act became law. #SaveACA 
California would be the hardest hit if Republicans repeal Obamacare with more than 334K jobs lost. #SaveACA
It‚Äôs shameful that Republicans want to repeal Obamacare &amp; leave 20 million Americans out in the cold with no feasible replacement.
.@PPact provides a number of health services including lifesaving cancer screenings &amp; family planning. 
2.6M jobs nationwide will be lost if the GOP repeals Obamacare. It isn‚Äôt perfect but we must fix and reform the law not repeal it.
Thanks to the #ACA:‚úì you can‚Äôt be denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions‚úì young Americans can stay on a parent's plan until age 26
I‚Äôm here to fight for you and the most vulnerable and voiceless in our society. This fight will be long &amp; hard but I won‚Äôt back down.
We see you and we‚Äôre here for you. You are worthy. 
I defended the constitutionality of Obamacare as Attorney General of CA &amp; will continue to fight for affordable care for all in the Senate.
75 straight months of job growth under @BarackObama is promising but we must still #raisethewage &amp; address CA's unmet transportation needs. 
If you or someone you know is in need of assistance due to flooding please contact your county: 
The Affordable Care Act isn‚Äôt perfect but there are millions of people relying on us to fix and reform the law not repeal it.
Maya Angelou said it best ‚Äî we must keep fighting for our values ideals and diversity. I hope you‚Äôre with me. 
'California first' is my mindset. I am entirely focused on defending California‚Äôs interests &amp; figuring out how to best represent our state.
Like our president I saw firsthand as a career prosecutor how our criminal justice system exacerbates inequality. 
As AG my team &amp; I defended consumers from predatory industries like Big Oil Wall Street &amp; for-profit colleges. I won‚Äôt back down now.
129M people are now protected from being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a routine occurrence before Obamacare was enacted. 
As Attorney General we worked w/ @PPact to build coalitions designed to combat threats of violence against health clinics. #StandWithPP
Like @MichelleObama said yesterday our nation‚Äôs youth are our nation‚Äôs future. We must do everything in our power to ensure their success. 
What we could see happen if the ACA is repealed: thousands of jobs lost &amp; millions without health insurance.
Comprehensive immigration reform will increase productivity &amp; wages will rise‚Äîan additional $250 in the pockets of median American household
No one should have to live their life in fear for practicing his or her religion. 
Attempts to defund @PPact do nothing except make it harder for women to get access to the health care they need. #StandWithPP
Stories like Taylor‚Äôs inspire me to continue fighting for justice for sexual assault victims. This is infuriating. 
If the Republicans repeal Obamacare 2.6 million jobs will be lost ‚Äî more than 334K in CA alone. We cannot afford to lose those jobs.
More than 20 million adults have insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act. 
No matter the threat we have an obligation to do right by the millions of women who rely on @PPact's services. #StandWithPP
We have a moral responsibility to end for-profit prisons &amp; instead implement proven strategies to prevent crime.
By consensus or because we have to fight we will do what‚Äôs right by the voiceless and vulnerable in our society.
.@PPact is a health care resource to millions of women &amp; men across the country. We must defend it. 
Just as we have done before in CA we must defend Planned Parenthood from outrageous attacks by GOP leadership. #StandWithPP
I will stand up for you and your rights no matter the obstacles that stand in my way. I hope you'll join me in this cause.
And yesterday I stood up for the 850000 CA patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for services like cancer screenings.
When I cast my vote I was thinking of the 20M people who would lose coverage if the ACA was dismantled without a suitable replacement.
On Wednesday I cast my first vote in the Senate voting against the Republican budget resolution that dismantles Obamacare.
On Tuesday I was sworn into office to serve the people of California in the U.S. Senate surrounded by my family and friends.
My first week in Washington as your Senator has been quite a busy week. (1/5)
My mother‚Äôs general philosophy was to speak the truth be honest and be clear of purpose. I try and live that philosophy every day.
We all must continue @JoeBiden‚Äôs fight against sexual violence when he leaves office. Violence against women is unacceptable. #ItsOnUs 
Since the ACA was enacted 129M+ people who would have been denied coverage for pre-existing conditions have access to health care. #ACAWorks 
This is going to be a moment that will challenge all of us to fight for the ideals of our country. There‚Äôs no question the stakes are high.
January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. CA has been a leader in fights against human trafficking &amp; I will continue that in the Senate.
As a career prosecutor I took on violent criminals transnational gangs big banks and oil companies. I'm ready for the fights ahead.
To those who are uncertain about the future I say this: I intend to fight for our state. I have your back. 
Add your name to our petition today &amp; recommit yourself to the cause of justice and equality in the coming months.
I take comfort in knowing that I have a coalition ‚Äî all of you ‚Äî who are standing with me as we bring California‚Äôs voice to the Senate.
This is what it looks like when millions of Americans come together to demand accountability from our government. 
Our diversity makes the fabric of our society stronger. We must embrace it not reject it.
Just as we did shortly after our election victory I am letting our immigrant communities know exactly where I stand on immigration reform.
These individuals were raised in this country and deserve to fully participate and earn a piece of the American dream.
As my first official act as California‚Äôs U.S. Senator I‚Äôm co-sponsoring legislation protecting the 744K DREAMers from being deported.
As AG I broke open CA's criminal justice data shining a light on the CJ system. As Senator I'll continue that fight for fairness &amp; justice.
@douglasemhoff: Swearing in selfie. So proud of my new Senator wife!  @KamalaHarris 
Last week I asked you to submit your stories about Obamacare &amp; what it means to you. Over the next month we‚Äôll be sharing those stories. 
Repealing Obamacare would negatively impact millions in our country. We must listen to Americans &amp; improve not cut.
For far too many people ‚Äúliberty and justice for all‚Äù is a promise we have YET to keep. We must change that.
@mayaharris_: Nice to start the new year on a happy note‚Äîexcited to see my sister @KamalaHarris sworn-in as a new U.S. Senator. 
Together we must work to protect the gains we‚Äôve made with environmental protections Obamacare and civil rights.
Today I was sworn-in to the U.S. Senate. I am humbled and honored to serve you and the people of California. Let‚Äôs get to work. 
It's up to all of us to defend and build on the progress made under President Obama these last eight years.
As I have said before the gains made by our opposition this Nov. are not permanent. Together we can create a diverse &amp; inclusive society. 
The stakes could not be higher for all of us this year. We can either retreat or we can fight. I intend to fight for who we are.
Together we must stand with the millions of Americans who are at-risk if the ACA is repealed. We must not neglect them.
As a career prosecutor my heart hurts every single time I hear of the death of another police officer. 
Wishing you and your family a happy and healthy new year! 
if you‚Äôll fight for an agenda that is rooted in justice equality tolerance and fairness in the coming year.
It‚Äôs vital that we remain invested in coalition building and vigilant in defending our values in the new year.
I will never stop fighting against commercial sexual exploitation.
We must strengthen protections against discriminatory laws modernize voter registration systems &amp; expand early voting.
2016 was a year with many highs and lows but I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to serve California in the U.S. Senate. 
Thinking of @JerryBrownGov and the rest of the family ‚Äî Sutter will be greatly missed. 
Wages may be seeing relatively modest increases but we can‚Äôt stop the #Fightfor15. 
A smarter criminal justice system is a moral necessity one that lives up to the ideals of righteousness that our nation was founded upon.
We must ensure DREAMers who want to fully participate in the American dream and give back to our country have that opportunity. 
Ours is the only industrialized country that lacks a national paid family leave policy. It‚Äôs wrong‚Äîfamilies deserve a safety net.
68% of CA‚Äôs previously uninsured individuals now have affordable health care. Make sure the GOP doesn't gut the ACA.
Attacking someone because of their race ethnicity gender religion or sexual orientation is unacceptable. 
You want to deal with the big issues like crime and mass incarceration? We already know how ‚Äî prevention &amp; focusing on our children.
Every woman should be allowed to make healthcare decisions for herself. Period. 
I've spent my career fighting for the voiceless and vulnerable &amp; against those who prey on others. I'll continue that fight in the Senate. 
Beginning Sunday CA motorists will no longer be able to hold their cellphones in their hands when they are driving.
Together we can make this a more perfect union. One where our economy works for everyone including our middle class.
Are you a parent to a fourth-grader? Get into hundreds of parks lands and waters ‚Äî for free! #EveryKidinaPark
We cannot allow coal companies big oil and big business to poison our water and our land. The stakes are too high.
No woman should be told she can‚Äôt run for public office. We must build the infrastructure &amp; encourage women to run. 
This is still a nation founded on the ideas of liberty &amp; equality for all‚Ää ‚Äî ‚Ääwe will not give in or deny anyone these values.
Wise words from Carrie Fisher. Her strength and determination both on-screen and off-screen inspired countless lives. 
There are millions of Americans relying on us to fix and reform Obamacare not repeal it. We can‚Äôt let them down. 
Short-sighted legislation intended to gut our social contract for future generations must be stopped. We must protect Medicare.
‚ÄúResearch shows that women‚Äôs advancement is critical to stability and to reducing political violence.‚Äù
We must use this moment to rededicate ourselves to the cause of justice equality and tolerance while building a coalition for progress.
I want all LGBT youth to know that you are worthy. You belong. You are not alone.
As AG I‚Äôve defended Obamacare from legal challenges &amp; expanded health care access for Californians. I‚Äôll do the same in the Senate.
Words of wisdom from President Obama: we have a ‚Äúresponsibility to the larger community and the larger nation.‚Äù
It‚Äôs time we bring smart innovative &amp; effective approaches to fighting crime fighting for consumers &amp; fighting for equal rights for all.
More than 8 million Californians have paid into the system for decades &amp; earned the right to access Medicare. We can‚Äôt leave them behind.
Frederick Douglass‚Äô inspiring statement about justice ‚Üí 
Merry Christmas! Wishing all of you a joyful day filled with friends and family. 
Happy Hanukkah! 
No matter what you're celebrating please take a moment to share with our campaign your holiday season story: 
All it takes is one small act of kindness to brighten someone‚Äôs day this holiday season. 
We've made important gains advocating for women &amp; girls at home &amp; abroad. These programs must remain a priority. 
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has been in place since 2009. We must raise the wage &amp; tie it to inflation. 
The gains made by our opponents are not permanent. Neither is the progress we make. That is why we must continue the fight.
Dismantling this intolerant &amp; discriminatory registry system is a step towards ensuring #NoMuslimRegistry. 
It‚Äôs up to all of us to come together and tackle what is broken in our criminal justice system. Learn more: 
I want all transgender Americans to know that I will fight for your rights. Period. 
I applaud @BarackObama for his commitment to protecting our natural resources both in CA and around the country.
An investment in our children is an investment in our future. 
A different perspective of California during our Fearless for the People bus tour. #TBT 
I will do everything in my power to protect the LGBT community from harmful legislation like this: 
If passed this bill would open a Pandora‚Äôs box and allow widespread discrimination against the LGBT community.
Here‚Äôs the truth: the First Amendment Defense Act does not enhance religious freedom. It is an attempt to undermine marriage equality.
The cause for civil rights is not won or lost in one election. It remains a constant struggle that all of us must participate in.
I‚Äôve spent my career fighting for Californians whose voices aren‚Äôt heard by the people in power. I‚Äôll continue this fight in the Senate. 
It‚Äôs appalling that the student debt crisis has forced tens of thousands of elderly Americans into poverty.
At a time when many Californians are uncertain of our future I will relentlessly fight for the ideals of our nation
Congratulations @Simone_Biles for being named @esnpW‚Äôs #IMPACT25 Woman of the Year! 
Take a look at how the Senate has changed since the longest-serving female Senator entered office ‚Üí
Our health care system should put people not profits first. We need stronger regulations of the pharma industry.  
As a community we have a responsibility to make sure that every child is safe is healthy and has access to a high-quality education. 
Students defrauded by predatory for-profit colleges deserve student-loan debt relief no matter who‚Äôs president.   
Mass incarceration &amp; revolving recidivism have devastating effects. We must stop treating all offenders the same.
I believe justice transcends our differences and allows for diverse inclusive societies ‚Äî like the kind we‚Äôve always strived for in CA.
Will we be a stronger state if #DREAMers are deported? Absolutely not ‚Äì they contribute every single day to CA.
Everyone deserves to feel a sense of safety and opportunity in their communities in California and in this country.
"As President Obama said we must ‚Äúinvest in our young people...&amp; make sure that they've got a chance to contribute."""
if you‚Äôre committed to working hard for your community and the pursuit of a better life for everyone.
I am willing to reach across the aisle to work together however I will not compromise on justice &amp; equality. 
I applaud the tech companies that are stepping up to say they will refuse to help build a Muslim registry if asked.
I‚Äôm proud that CA has one of the toughest equal pay laws in the country &amp; in the Senate I‚Äôll work to make equal pay a reality in America. 
Here's the truth: the economic impact of privatizing Medicare will be devastating for seniors. We must #SaveMedicare
We must have transparency &amp; accountability in our criminal justice system especially with facts about race. 
We must work to build trust between immigrant communities &amp; law enforcement to ensure that immigrants feel safe enough to report crimes.
As AG I‚Äôve challenged federal policy that attempted to turn CA‚Äôs law enforcement into de facto Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement agents.
Criminals rely on immigrants not to report crimes to police because of their immigration status. This makes us unsafe &amp; weakens our society. 
Obamacare has delivered access to quality affordable health coverage to millions in CA ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget to sign up! 
@HowardU: Check out  @HUPrez17's November Edition of the #BisonBeat Newsletter incl. congrats to New Senator @KamalaHarris 
CA has been a leader in the fight against cyber exploitation or posting intimate images online without consent.
In the Senate I‚Äôll always have the mindset of California first. I‚Äôm ready to fight for the people of our state &amp; our rights.
America is a place built on ‚Äúcan‚Äù where opportunity exists for everyone. We must never give up fighting for that America. 
Every action we make has a profound impact on our children and their future. It‚Äôs vital we think about them when making decisions.
Please add your name to our urgent petition demanding the Republicans abandon their plans to privatize Medicare:
I applaud @usedgov for this. Lax oversight by an accrediting agency helped schools defraud students. 
‚ÄúA history of the first African American White House‚Äîand of what came next.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs the truth: no one should be denied housing employment or the right to marry because of who they love.
It‚Äôs so encouraging to see so many women who want to run for office. 
I intend to fight for commonsense gun safety because it‚Äôs the right thing to do. I have not forgotten the lives lost in Sandy Hook.
Together we can continue to build a powerful coalition that is ready to work towards a better future for ourselves &amp; for every generation. 
This is good news for the millions of people who use @PPact. But the fight for women's reproductive freedoms is far from over. 
Honor the 26 lives lost at #SandyHook four years ago today with an act of kindness. 
Congress‚Äô failure to pass legislation to renew the assault weapons ban is shameful. It is in the best interest of keeping our country safe.
If women‚Äôs reproductive rights come under attack in the Senate I will be there standing up for women everywhere. 
We must take on science-deniers who insist that the Earth is flat the Loch Ness monster is real &amp; climate change doesn‚Äôt exist. 
California must be a voice of leadership in Washington D.C. on immigration. It‚Äôs vital that we defend ALL people.
Here are 11 good things that happened in 2016:
It‚Äôs time we made higher education affordable for all not just the wealthy and the well-connected. #highered
I completely agree @LorettaLynch ‚Äî hate crimes are ‚Äúa stain on our nation‚Äôs very soul.‚Äù
We will stand firm w/our immigrant communities against mass deportations. We will not give in to racism &amp; xenophobia
This evening I got to thank many SoCal supporters in person. I'm grateful I'll be entering the Senate with #TeamKamala behind me! 
Let‚Äôs be clear: Climate change is real and it poses a great risk to California and our nation. 
Behind-the-scenes photo taken on our Fearless For The People Tour bus during the campaign trail. 
Our work is just beginning. We need you now more than ever. Join #TeamKamala for all the latest news updates: 
DACA is not a partisan issue ‚Äî it‚Äôs an issue that touches on respect justice dignity and equality. #SaveDACA
We must rededicate ourselves to:‚òëÔ∏è Criminal justice reform‚òëÔ∏è Ending the student debt crisis‚òëÔ∏è Strengthening Social Security &amp; Medicare
Now is the time to rise above petty partisan politics to reform and strengthen Obamacare not repeal it. 
It‚Äôs up to all of us to be vigilant when seeing false news stories being shared and call them out as false. 
We must and will not remain silent in a time that requires us to be louder than ever. 
Equal pay isn‚Äôt just about fairness and justice for women in the workforce ‚Äî it‚Äôs about justice for their families too.
We aren‚Äôt a country who treats those facing oppression as outsiders ‚Äî we are a country of immigrants. They deserve compassion &amp; opportunity.
‚ÄúDear Gwen Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for always putting substance over style.‚Äù 
The giraffe population has shrunk nearly 40% in just 30 years. This is why habitat protection programs are critical.
Let‚Äôs fight for a more perfect union where we rescue our planet from climate change and put an end to oil companies manipulating our laws.
When people of all ages all colors all religions all backgrounds are unified in their fight for justice we will overcome all obstacles. 
Women‚Äôs rights.LGBT rights.Indigenous rights.Immigration rights.On #HumanRightsDay let‚Äôs re-dedicate ourselves to fighting for all.
We must ensure we never forget the transgender people who have been murdered because of their gender identity ‚Üí 
Bringing together the tech-savvy students &amp; government can lead to innovative problem solving.
This man is spreading the holiday spirit &amp; because of him 10 people get to visit their families over the holidays.
The Bay Area continues to come together after last week's tragedy with shows benefitting warehouse fire victims: 
We have a responsibility to fight for justice and equality for ALL Americans not a select few. 
As far as I‚Äôm concerned a child going without an education is tantamount to a crime. We must ensure everyone receives a quality education.
Background checks for gun buyers are necessary to keeping our children safe while they‚Äôre at school.
@nickgourevitch: 7: 63% say immigrants are more of a strength than a burden HIGHEST LEVEL ON THIS IN 20 YEARS OF PEW SURVEYS (sorry for‚Ä¶
An EPA head that denies climate change is like a NASA Administrator who doesn‚Äôt believe in gravity. Dangerous and alarming. 
So much of the progress we have made on civil rights equality and justice are on the line right now. We must fight on.
.@BarbaraBoxer thank you for your kind words. I'll strive to be a strong progressive voice in the Senate. 
John Glenn was a pioneer both in space and in the Senate. My heart goes out to his family and friends. 
There are millions of people relying on us to fix and reform the Affordable Care Act not repeal it. 
I will work to restore trust between our communities &amp; law enforcement work to raise the minimum wage and take action on climate change.
Thank you @SenatorReid for your service to this country. Your expertise courage and tenacity will be missed in the U.S. Senate.
The continued move to profit off the mass incarceration of people in this country is deeply disturbing. 
We must become more active and vigilant in fighting for the progress we have made on civil rights and more. 
What issues are you most interested in engaging on and how would you like to be active in our growing movement?
Congress needs to address climate change in a bold way. It‚Äôs time the US helps lead the world and this starts by setting a strong example.
Now is the time to intensify the fight for our environment not abandon it. Our children‚Äôs future literally depends on it.
I intend to fight against those naysayers who suggest there is no such thing as climate change.
We must work even harder to protect American consumers from predatory practices that some continue to pursue. 
I intend to fight for: ‚òëÔ∏è Communities of Color‚òëÔ∏è Women  ‚òëÔ∏è Immigrant Families ‚Ä¶and all those who are vulnerable in our politics. 
This advice given to me from Senator @BarbaraBoxer applies to all of us. Now is not the time to be silent. We must fight. 
Yes we are @Rendon63rd and we aren‚Äôt going to give up on our values and ideals because of one election. 
This is a powerful ad that underscores the urgent need for us to rethink our approach to tackling gun violence. 
I know I have big shoes to fill and it is because @BarbaraBoxer has been such an incredible leader for California. 
Just as I‚Äôve done as CA‚Äôs AG I will lead the charge to fight against all forms of discrimination particularly against the LGBT community. 
Repealing Obamacare would be a disaster for millions of Americans. We must amend the law. Improve it. Not eliminate it.
Right now is a time to bring people together to unite around our shared values and to reject the divisive game of the status quo.
Demagoguing or outright attacking communities of color is not a real plan. It is a recipe for disaster.
Our work is just beginning and I‚Äôm eager to advance the causes of justice &amp; equality as your advocate in Congress 
Private prisons are a bad deal for taxpayers. We should not incentivize corporations to profit off mass incarceration.
Working families in America deserve a government that works for them not just powerful special interests or the very wealthy.
You are not alone. We are all in this together. We will fight. 
The fight for civil rights‚Äîthe fight for justice and equality‚Äîmust be fought and won with each generation.
If you can afford it please make an urgent donation to help the victims of the Ghostship Oakland Fire:  #oaklandfire
‚ÄúI want to believe in the goodness of people no matter their ideology or where they sit on the political divide.‚Äù 
Now is the time to fight for our values of justice and equality. Don‚Äôt give in. Don‚Äôt give up. 
Please take a quick moment to recommit yourself to the urgent cause of justice and equality in this country: 
You can count on me to stand up to those who spread disinformation and tell you the truth even when it‚Äôs hard. 
Sending strength and prayers to Oakland for those lost and suffering. A terrible terrible tragedy.
We must stop shameless for-profit colleges from issuing worthless degrees to students who graduate buried in debt. 
When a woman does 100% of the work their male counterparts do they deserve 100% of the pay. It‚Äôs as simple as that.
‚ÄúI think the most important constraint on any president is the American people themselves.‚Äù ‚ÄîPresident @BarackObama
Treating all offenders the same way regardless of the severity of their offense is ineffective and outdated.
It is important now more than ever that we openly and honestly listen to each other: 
We simply cannot return to letting Wall Street banks build their private American dream while working families watch theirs slip away.
Prior convictions shouldn‚Äôt automatically prevent a qualified applicant from getting a job. #BanTheBox
We may be strangers but we are connected in this movement‚Ää. We all have a responsibility to take action in the coming months and years.
CA AG nominee @XavierBecerra is a dedicated public servant who has fought tirelessly for immigrants homeowners and working families
DACA gives young immigrants who were brought here as children a chance to give back. Read some of their stories: 
As your senator I will never back down from challenging powerful special interest groups.
Teachers are on the frontlines of our education system. We must ensure we are attracting &amp; retaining the brightest.
More than a thousand stories about the election were submitted to our campaign. This word cloud shows their concerns &amp; hopes for the future. 
Sixty-one years ago today Rosa Parks sparked a revolution when she refused to give up her bus seat. We must continue her fight for justice.
Congrats to the 40 Under 40 Tech Diversity honorees! I celebrate these talented trailblazers &amp; hope to see many more
Although the national day of action for the #FightFor15 may be over our fight for a living wage continues each and every day. 
Californians intend to fight for equality‚Äîthat's what I learned from reading your stories after the election:
We must not sink our college students with a lifetime of debt just so big banks and for-profit colleges can bathe in the riches.
These next few months are about moving forward. It‚Äôs about who we are &amp; who we want to be. Together we can make this a more perfect union.
Leaving millions of women without health benefits is not an option. I will fight for quality health care. 
We must never forget that we are a nation of immigrants. If you‚Äôre a DACA recipient tweet me your story using #DACAstory. #SaveDACA 
1 in 3 #DREAMers lives in CA &amp; contributes every day to our state. It‚Äôs time we #SaveDACA and work together to protect our nation‚Äôs DREAMers
740000 DREAMers grew up pledging allegiance to the only flag they know ‚Äì the American flag. We must work together to #SaveDACA. 
I‚Äôm proud to join my future colleagues in calling on our next administration to #SaveDACA &amp; protect DREAMers. They deserve our support.
I want you to know @TmacShakur‚Äîand everyone who is feeling what she‚Äôs feeling‚Äîthat you are not alone. 
Let‚Äôs do what is necessary to unite as a country on criminal justice reform by finding common ground on the reforms we need right now.
Wow America only has only 4.4% of the world's population but almost half of the world‚Äôs civilian-owned guns. 
It‚Äôs abysmal that the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. You can‚Äôt live off that. It‚Äôs time for a $15 minimum wage. #FightFor15
We must not remain silent during the next four years. Instead we must take action and speak up. 
Students at colleges across our state must be allowed to continue their studies without fear of deportation.  #DACA
I firmly believe that investment in early education ‚Äî both at home and at school ‚Äî paves the way for success. 
Our current federal minimum wage would earn you less than $15000 a year ‚Äî that‚Äôs very close to the poverty line. We need to #FightFor15.
Our broken criminal justice system robs individuals of opportunity and deprives communities of hope. We need action.
Climate change is a reality we must confront. We must not abandon our environment at this critical moment in time. 
We cannot disengage or retreat over the next four years. We must remain steadfast in our fight for justice. 
Happy 50th birthday to the @LAZoo and Botanical Gardens! 
We all must say loud and clear that attacks on the Muslim community are attacks on all of us Americans. 
Here‚Äôs the truth: we must actively reject racism and xenophobia in our politics.
It‚Äôs vital to think about others not just ourselves. 
In the Senate I‚Äôm going to fight for national paid family and sick leave policies that provide a safety net for working families.
All Americans deserve the chance to vote. We must make it easier to vote &amp; work to stop voter suppression: 
If you haven‚Äôt already make sure you‚Äôre following me on @Medium where I discuss how we can fight for justice: 
Predatory for-profit colleges leave students burdened by debt &amp; without jobs. They must end. 
If this year has taught me anything it‚Äôs to stay involved. Own a piece of our future. Fight on.
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Join me on #SmallBizSat and #ShopSmall.
Today is #SmallBizSat a day to support small businesses &amp; their contributions to the community. Are you supporting a local store today? 
We must think long term about the effects of climate change not short term.
When we work together we can accomplish anything no matter what obstacles are in our way that make it seem impossible.
Hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! What was your favorite part of yesterday? Mine was spending time with family.
#FlashbackFriday to the DNC Convention this past July. The banner behind us says ‚Äúbold solutions begin with us.‚Äù We must remember that. 
Thanksgiving is a time to come together as a family and as a community ‚Äî something I believe is more important now than ever before.
#IAmThankfulFor: California. It‚Äôs such a beautiful and diverse state filled with caring and compassionate people. 
#IAmThankfulFor: Obamacare which allows almost 6M young adults up to the age of 26 to stay on their parent‚Äôs health insurance.
#IAmThankfulFor: Living in a country where every single person has the right to marry the person they love.
This Thanksgiving I‚Äôm so very grateful for all the hard work and support you gave to our campaign this past year. #HappyThanksgiving 
Our unity is our strength and our diversity is our power. 
We must be a voice for the vulnerable and the voiceless. For those that can‚Äôt speak up I will speak up for you.
More than 102M trees have died in CA. All levels of gov must work together to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
My mother very much defined success as not only what you accomplish but what you accomplish for others. #WednesdayWisdom
We‚Äôve come so far in the past 20 years and I will fight to make sure we continue that progress. 
I will not compromise on the values of justice and equality we laid out for our campaign. Ever.
I‚Äôm looking forward to working with and for Smart Girls across the country! 
I know many of you are feeling powerless but with the cause of justice and equality being so urgent at this time we must not despair.
The American people deserve comprehensive immigration reform that favors respect and dignity‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää not unrealistic plans to build a wall.
We must rededicate ourselves to the battle for who we are as a nation and work to fulfill the promise of a better life for all. 
We have a history in California of standing up for what‚Äôs right. I promise to continue that. 
Children shouldn‚Äôt fall behind before they even start kindergarten. We must keep them in school and on track. 
Every American deserves access to affordable quality healthcare. I intend to fight to protect that access to comprehensive care.
As your Senator I will be fearless for the people and never back down from challenging powerful special interest groups.
The cause of justice and equality has never been more urgent. Are you ready to stand together and fight for it?  
We won‚Äôt back down. We won‚Äôt let our voices become silent. Now is too critical of a time to become complacent. 
We must guarantee equal pay for equal work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor all women‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether she be a construction worker or a CEO.
Today spread joy ‚Äî not hate. 
Let‚Äôs make this a more perfect union by reversing Citizens United because we know Citizens United really means Citizens Divided.
116 California parks across the state will be free on Black Friday. Find out how to get your free day pass ‚Üí
The cause of civil rights is not won or lost in one election. It remains a constant struggle that we have a responsibility to participate in
CA has $59 billion in unmet transportation needs. We must work on upgrading our transportation infrastructure.
One of the best ways we can achieve justice is by making sure we set up a system that will protect victims.
I got lost a few of times in the Senate building this week but our first week has been a busy one to say the least.
The people of CA deserve to have a leader representing their voices on climate change immigration &amp; water resources
Excited to work with @SenGillibrand &amp; @CoryBooker! 
We must let millions of people in this country‚Äîour kids immigrants communities of color &amp; women‚Äîknow that they are not alone.
Internment camps are a shameful part of our history not a precedent we should follow to enable discrimination. 
We need an Attorney General who will stand with us in the urgent cause of justice and equality for all. There can be no exceptions.
He will get a fair hearing in the Senate as all nominees should but make no mistake: I intend to engage as aggressively as I can.
His support for policies that undermine core DOJ duties make me worry Sessions is unable to defend the civil rights of all Americans.
I have many concerns about @realDonaldTrump's nominees to date but Senator Sessions is a particularly troubling choice.
I‚Äôve never been afraid to take on corporations &amp; fight for the people. I‚Äôll do the same when I‚Äôm in Washington. 
Now is the time to come together to advance an agenda that is rooted in fighting for what makes America actually great.
It‚Äôs about rejecting ‚Äúus-versus-them‚Äù and that mantra of ‚Äúyesterday.‚Äù It‚Äôs about signifying we are stronger when we stand together.
We can make this a more perfect union where our children have an opportunity to achieve their potential through access to quality education.
It‚Äôs about moving forward. Together. It‚Äôs about who we are and who we want to be all of us.
One where our economy works for everyone and where a minimum wage means a minimum standard of living and a minimum standard of dignity.
I am optimistic about our future. Together we can move forward and make this a more perfect union. 
‚ÄúWe have an obligation to end trafficking here and everywhere.‚Äù I completely agree @SenFeinstein. 
Targeting &amp; registering Muslims because of their faith goes against everything we stand for as Americans. We are better than that.
Racial profiling bias and the lack of trust between law enforcement and communities of color must be addressed:
We must rededicate ourselves to the fight for who we are and build a coalition that is ready to join that fight ‚Üí 
Tell us how you‚Äôd like to get involved in this urgent fight for justice and equality going forward: 
One presidential election cannot erase our values ideals and diversity as a nation ‚Äî but only if we come together and FIGHT.
We‚Äôre celebrating American Education Week! Investing in education is a surefire way to ensure children can succeed later in life. #AEW2016 
Here‚Äôs the deal: our ideals are at stake right now and we will have to fight for who we are. Will you join me?
Do not despair. I will be in the Senate fighting for you and your rights. 
I‚Äôm optimistic on working with GOP in Congress &amp; also ready to fight for the ideals laid out during our campaign.  
I‚Äôm in DC this week for Senate orientation. Meet the Senate freshman class of 2016 ‚Üí
I want to be loud and clear: no matter what we will not compromise our ideals or values.
Climate change is real. We can either ignore it or take action. I say we take action. 
@SenatorDurbin: Honored to welcome these newly-elected Sens to DC‚Äìeach brings a unique experience&amp;new energy to our efforts to address i‚Ä¶
Thanks for showing me around your office @SenWarren! Looking forward to working together. 
We must bring justice dignity and fairness to documented and undocumented immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform. 
I was blessed to sit down with Gwen Ifill this year &amp; discuss why it‚Äôs harder for women to run for office.
Right now is a time to bring people together and unite our country around the common values and ideals that actually make us great.
We are stronger when we are inclusive. Period. 
We need to have the courage to say loud and clear that attacks on Muslim-Americans are attacks on all Americans. 
We have the power to give a voice to the voiceless in Washington as we advance an agenda rooted in justice and equality.
I want all LGBTQ people in California and across the nation to know ‚Äî you are not alone.
Gwen Ifill was a role model for a generation of young people both in and outside of journalism. My prayers are with her family &amp; friends.
I was honored by the effort and time she invested in our friendship when I was just a young prosecutor.
I‚Äôm so saddened by the passing of Gwen Ifill. Gwen was a dedicated friend brilliant journalist &amp; trailblazer for women &amp; African Americans.
Trump's comments are reprehensible and ignorant. I will do everything in my power to defend Roe v. Wade.
We must work to protect our immigrant communities through real reforms not mass deportation. 
Our children‚Äôs future literally depends on it. 
I intend to fight for commonsense gun safety. I have not forgotten the lives lost in San Bernardino or Sandy Hook.
It‚Äôs time to get to work and make plans. Join our fight for justice: 
I stand with @JerryBrownGov in saying that California will not back down on climate change. 
We need pathways to citizenship not un-American &amp; unrealistic plans to break up families. This is a recipe for disaster @realDonaldTrump. 
We are not voiceless. We will not be discouraged. Over the next four years help us fight for the future of this country.
It‚Äôs time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are.
Our campaign for Senate has ended but the work is just beginning. Please stay involved. 
Representation is critically important especially at a time like this. 
I intend to fight for the civil rights of all people. No one should be denied housing employment or the right to marry the person they love
Add your name if you agree: we must reject racism and xenophobia and work to protect our immigrant communities.
Let our values ideals and diversity unite us instead of divide us. 
What will a Trump presidency mean for our environment? 
These acts of hate and bigotry will not stand. The cause of justice and equality has never been more urgent.
No one should ever have to feel this way but we must never give up hope. You are not alone. #LoveTrumpsHate 
CA has the largest number of immigrants both documented and undocumented in the US ‚Äî and I will fight for them. We are stronger together.
We cannot ignore what is happening to communities of color in our nation. We must reject racism and rise above hate. 
To all of our veterans here in California and across the country: thank you for your service. #VeteransDay 
We have the power to give a voice to the voiceless and advance an agenda rooted in justice and equality.
I intend to fight for our students and invest in them. We cannot let them graduate with devastating amounts of debt.
Sign our petition right now to let everyone know you are standing with our immigrant communities: 
We must reject racism and xenophobia in our politics as we work to protect our immigrant communities through real reforms.
Demagoguing or outright attacking communities of color is not a real plan‚Äîit is a recipe for disaster.
We must come together right now‚Ää ‚Ääand fight for who we are and the country we want to be. 
This is a moment that is challenging to all of us. It‚Äôs time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are as a nation.

We need to make sure our lawmakers are representing ALL of the people they serve. We are stronger when we are inclusive.
The election is over and now it's time to get to work and make plans. Building a wall and having Mexico pay for it is not a realistic plan. 
In a few minutes I'll be joining immigrant families and immigrant rights activists for a post-election rally at @chirlafund. 
Thank you Team Kamala for your extraordinary commitment and support. I‚Äôm honored to have the opportunity to be your next Senator. 
We can either retreat or we can fight. I intend to FIGHT for who we are. I hope you will join me.
Let us have the courage to stand up for the ideals of our country. Don‚Äôt lose heart. Show heart.
Private prisons are morally wrong. It is hurtful to see them profiting today but we cannot despair. We must fight on
This is a pivotal moment in the history of our country and our ideals are at stake. We must give it our all and fight for who we are.
I intend to fight for our ideals. I intend to fight for our civil rights. And I intend to fight to make our communities stronger. 
@BarbaraBoxer: I am very gratified that @KamalaHarris will be my successor in the Senate. She is the proven fighter California and Ameri‚Ä¶
This is a time to fight for who we are. Do not give up. Do not give in. Fight back. 
Our ideals are at stake. Our country is at stake. Let's get to work. No retreat. 
I could not do any of this without you. Thank you for your support. Let's get to work! 
We must not despair. We must not be overwhelmed or throw up our hands. It is time to roll up our sleeves and fight for who we are!
This is a moment that challenges us and I know we will rise to the occasion.
We are a great country and part of what makes us a great country is that we fight for our ideals.
We are collectively being called on to look in the mirror with furrowed brow and ask: who are we? I believe the answer is a good one.
I intend to fight to make sure all of our communities are stronger. Our ideals are at stake right. We have to fight for who we are.
I intend to fight for commonsense gun safety because it‚Äôs just the right thing to do.
I intend to fight. I intend to fight against those naysayers who say there is no such thing as climate change.
Do we retreat or do we fight? WE FIGHT!
We know that we have a task in front of us. We must do everything in our power to heal and bring this country together.

So proud to have Supervisor @HildaSolis stand with us as we fight for California! 
@hannahrvega: Thus far @KamalaHarris has discussed tuition reform criminal justice immigration and guns and how CA leads the way
Part of the ongoing fight for equality is making higher education affordable! 
We are a great country. And tomorrow we'll go to the polls to vote and fight for our ideals. #ElectionDay #vote

@jehabig: Packed house in Anaheim for @KamalaHarris bus tour stop and rally with Josh Newman #teamKamala 
"Mayor @RobertGarciaLB: ""I've been proud to be with Kamala since day 1!""And I've been proud to have your support! "
So glad to see this little one at our rally in OC with State Senate candidate Josh Newman -- she had a lot to say during the event! 
We must continue having an open dialogue about criminal justice reform &amp; work together to rebuild lost trust. 
No regrets on Wednesday. Let‚Äôs do the hard work to get the job done today and tomorrow to win this election.
I am here to thank you for your support of me for your support of Josh and to ask you to push a little harder over the next 24 hours.
We need courageous leaders like Josh Newman in the State Senate to tackle critical issues like gun violence and criminal justice reform.
On guns: we want background checks we want a ban on assault weapons. That‚Äôs just reasonable.
"The term ""illegal alien‚Äù is offensive and we must stop treating undocumented workers as criminals in this country."
Josh has been an incredible leader on immigration reform. He knows that we cannot conflate immigration policy with criminal justice policy.
I believe we are a great country because we were founded on the idea in 1776 that we are all and should be treated as equals.
This time in our country is as pivotal as ever. We must look in the mirror with furrowed brow and ask the question: who are we?
The work that comes out of Sacramento has a profound impact on all of us‚Äîincluding millions of people we will never meet.
All the oxygen has been sucked out of the room by the presidential election but it matters who we elect on the local level.
In Anaheim to stand with Josh Newman and his campaign today as part of our Fearless for the People bus tour! 
‚ù§Ô∏è 
One day until #ElectionDay. Let's do this California! 
It is the very nature of this fight for justice and equality that the gains we make will not be permanent. We must be vigilant.
If you need an assault weapon to go hunting then you need to go back to hunting school.
We need commonsense gun safety legislation like background checks and banning assault weapons. That's kind of reasonable if you ask me.
Politicians like @ApplegateCA49's opponent conflate immigration policy w/ criminal justice reform. That is irresponsible thinking.
Let's make sure we have no regrets on November 9th. Get out there and vote tomorrow!
This is a moment in time where we must stand up and fight for the ideals of this country. And I believe California will lead the way.
I believe the answer is a good one. We are a great county. Imperfect but great.
This is an inflection moment in our history like the Civil Rights movement. We have to ask: what kind of country do we want to be?
".@ApplegateCA49 ""We need a leader like Kamala in the Senate. She knows how to get results and make a difference for our families!"""
".@ApplegateCA49 ""I want to be an important ally to the next Senator from California: Kamala Harris!"""
".@ApplegateCA49: ""The people want and deserve new leadership that is about accountability integrity and transparency."""
".@ApplegateCA49 ""We cannot take this election for granted. We have to get out and vote."""
Proud to stand with @ApplegateCA49 today! He is a good man who has served our country and California with honor and distinction. 
Sending my condolences to the family and friends of Janet Reno who broke the glass ceiling as she fought for justice.
Don‚Äôt wake up on November 9th with regrets ‚Äî make a plan!  
Making the final push with @MaxineWaters and @KarenBassTweets! Their support has lifted up our campaign. #gotv 
As AG I‚Äôve worked to bring smart and effective approaches to fighting crime fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all.
For-profit colleges target vulnerable students &amp; then leave them buried in debt after graduation. This can‚Äôt go on. 
California needs @AMuratsuchi in the Assembly! If you've already voted for him stop by his Torrance campaign office to help out. #ad66
