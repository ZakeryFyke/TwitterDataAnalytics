Now that #FY18NDAA passed Congress must appropriate the vital funding we just authorized starting with a bipartisan budget agreement. 
The Senate's overwhelming &amp; bipartisan passage of the #FY18NDAA delivers America's men &amp; women in uniform the support they need &amp; deserve. 
Proud the Senate voted 89-8 to pass the #FY18NDAA to rebuild the military &amp; give our troops the training equipment &amp; resources they need.
By identifying &amp; eliminating troubled programs the #FY18NDAA reins in unnecessary defense spending &amp; reinvests savings in our warfighters 
I'll be speaking on the Senate floor shortly on the Senate's vote to pass the #FY18NDAA a vital bill for troops: 
#FY18NDAA strengthens #Pentagon accountability &amp; streamlines the process for getting our troops the equipment training &amp; resources they need

The #FY18NDAA is more vital than ever. As #Russia #China &amp; #NorthKorea escalate threats we must have a military that‚Äôs ready &amp; able.

.@BV is right - the best thing to do with the archaic &amp; protectionist #JonesAct is to scrap it. 
The threats to our security have never been more complex. We must have a ready &amp; capable military to rise to those challenges. #FY18NDAA 
For 55 consecutive years the NDAA has been signed into law. In our partisan climate the #FY18NDAA is a bill that can make both sides proud 
The #FY18NDAA reduces wasteful spending by terminating troubled &amp; redundant programs identifying inefficiencies &amp; reining in spending 
The #FY18NDAA reforms the #Pentagon to strengthen accountability streamline #Pentagon processes &amp; spur innovation in defense tech 
The #FY18NDAA authorizes $8.5B to strengthen homeland regional &amp; space missile defenses to counter provocations from #NorthKorea
