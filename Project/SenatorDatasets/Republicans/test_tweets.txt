Tomorrow is the final day Cambodian citizens can register to vote in 2018 elections. Hun Sen must take the first step toward reestablishing democratic credibility by freeing Kem Sokha. If he does not then in return I'll work to ban responsible officials from traveling to the US. 
This attempt from the Cambodian government to assuage the United States is deeply concerning. 
I commend @RepDeSantis for @gopoversight hearing on the importance of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital &amp; moving the US embassy there. 
This National Day for Victims of Communism we honor the memory of millions who have died &amp; the plights of those who still suffer under totalitarian regimes. 
Happy Birthday Rev. @BillyGraham! Your remarkable ministry has uplifted millions &amp; inspired entire generations.
Senate should repeal #Obamacare’s individual mandate in tax reform bill keeping more money in #Americans’ pockets-&gt; 
@SteveDaines: .@SenTedCruz is right — we need to repeal the individual mandate. It is a fine on the poor in our country. 
In case you missed my interview with @ShannonBream on @foxnewsnight last night watch it here -&gt; 
Tax cuts are critical and I believe we can get it done. 
There is a path forward to true tax cuts in repealing Obamacare. Tax payers are losing exemptions &amp; paying higher taxes- that is a mistake. 
The main focus of these tax cuts should be on jobs jobs jobs and more jobs for all #Americans. 
@sendavidperdue: .@SenTedCruz is right: changing the tax code is about creating more opportunity for American workers and families. 
We must fulfill our promises made to the #American people &amp; provide true tax cuts for all. 
Tune in at 10am CT for our LIVE press event on the need for true tax cuts for #American families -&gt;
