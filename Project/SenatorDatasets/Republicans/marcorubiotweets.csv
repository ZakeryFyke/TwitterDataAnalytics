These aggressive moves against #Kurds in #Iraq orchestrated by #Iran makes them stronger at the expense of U.S.  
Excited to be working with @IvankaTrump and members of the House and Senate to ensure an expanded #ChildTaxCredit is part of tax reform. 
I commend @POTUS for declaring the #opioidcrisis a public health emergency. Too many in #Florida have fallen victim to this epidemic.
Tax reform must help working families not just people who can afford lobbyists. 
The incompetent regime of @NicolasMaduro is on the verge of defaulting on bond debt. #Venezuela deserves better.

Whoever meddles in the quarrel of anotheris one who grabs a passing dog by the ears. Proverbs 26:17
In many states child care is even more expensive than college. An expanded #childtaxcredit will help families struggling to make ends meet.

Don't agree with everything herebut one thing clear for working families #ChildTax Credit Is the Key to #TaxReform

Without the child tax credit there will be no tax relief for working families. Now is the time to get it done.

@POTUS .@EU_Commission has no grounds to demand we treat #IranDeal as a binding agreement. Never ratified as treaty per OUR constitution.
@POTUS Supporters say inspections prevent #Iran from developing nuke.But leave out that deal allows #Iran to inspect itself on military site. 2/2
"Ridiculous ""Expert"" hyperbole about @potus move on #IranDeal As currently structured deal is 21st century equivalent of Munich Agreement 1/2"

.@potus right to decertify #IranDeal. But I have real doubt whether even possible to fix such a flawed deal. 
Thank you to all the men and women of the @USNavy who for 242 years have been protecting and serving our country. 
Filter out the noise &amp; focus on the task. We will help our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico help themselves as much &amp; for as long as it takes
I support @POTUS decision to decertify. Now Congress must either fix #IranDeal by creating triggers for sanctions or deal should end 3/3
In addition #IranDeal is only on nukes.It can't be that it requires us to ignore #Iran sponsorship of terror or advances in missiles. 2/3
#IranDeal has 3 very serious flaws.Sunsets too early no enforcement given to IAEA &amp; allows advanced R&amp;D to continue on centrifuges. 1/3

#TaxRelief 4 working families depends almost entirely on our plan with @IvankaTrump @SenMikeLee to increase #ChildTaxCredit in #TaxReform 
You have been snared by the utterance of your lipscaught by the words of your mouth; Proverbs 6:2
Families are the cornerstone of American life and our economy. I support an increased child tax credit—tax reform that puts families first. 
@CLINTHREED: How important is the #childtaxcredit to overall #TaxReform?  #dataviz 
"Probably a good time to use ""Let me rephrase that"" :  "
Apparently the @NicolasMaduro clown show is performing in Moscow this week. The biggest threat to Venezuela is the Maduro regime.
Increasing #ChildTaxCredit best way to help working families with rising cost of everything. MUST do in #TaxReform 
Indeed the ways of each person are plain to the LORD’s sight;all their paths he surveys. Proverbs 5:21
In Puerto Rico Health Concerns Grow Amid Lack of Clean Water Medical Care 
With all vigilance guard your heart for in it are the sources of life. Proverbs 4:23
The idea that over 20 American Embassy personnel could be severely injured in Cuba &amp; the Cuban govt. not know about it is ridiculous. 
@realDonaldTrump @DeptofDefense @fema Still a long road ahead but things really starting turning since Gen. Buchanan &amp; his team arrived to help @FEMA &amp; @ricardorossello 2/2
As @realDonaldTrump visits  #PuertoRico 2day we are slowly but surely starting to see progress made by @DeptofDefense &amp; @FEMA surge 1/2
@Nicklaus4Kids Some of the great efforts to help the most needy.  Still much work to do. #PuertoRicoStrong 
The decision to expel 2/3 of Castro regime employees from embassy in D.C. was the right decision by @realDonaldTrump &amp; @StateDept #Cuba
Whether working Americans get a #TaxCut will depend almost entirely on how much we increase the #ChildTaxCredit as part of #TaxReform

@fema This is the logistical challenge I want @DeptofDefense given the task &amp; authority to solve. Hopeful we will see that begin today
Some of criticism of #PuertoRicoRelief missing main problem. @FEMA has sent lots of aid problem is distribution once it gets to #PuertoRico
You can see the street-by-street damage in #PuertoRico using this interactive map.  #Sayfie
After less than day on ground General in charge of #PuertoRicoRelief confirms we need more robust military presence  
Shameful that @StateDept withdraws most staff from @USEmbCuba but Castro can keep as many as he wants in U.S. 
@StateDept @USEmbCuba So Castro regime allows attacks on Americans forcing us to drawdown to keep them safe but he gets to keep about same # of people here? 2/2
Some at @StateDept want massive drawdown of Americans at @USEmbCuba but allow Castro to keep regime embassy in DC virtually the same 1/2
The ill-tempered stir up strifeand the hotheaded cause many sins. Proverbs 29:22
Good that  3star general going to #PuertoRico. Now give him the authority to restore logistics without bureaucracy 
Multiple chains of command isnt going to work. Need effective unified command until supply logistics are sufficient to deliver aid.
"On #PuertoRicoRelief: ""There are multiple agencies local &amp;federal at workwith multiple chains of command""  "
@USEmbassyHavana Idea that in one of most closely controlled nations in world 21 Americans injured in attacks &amp; Castro regime knows nothing is laughable
Any reduction of Americans from @USEmbassyHavana should also require equal number of Castro employees leaving regime's embassy in U.S.
No organization on the planet is better at disaster response than our military. They are needed on the ground leading in Puerto Rico.

Why should U.S. taxpayer fund 21% of budget of UN that's increasingly a forum for anti-semitism &amp; anti-Americanism? 
Here is the part where the Dolphin fan in me hopes he announces he is retiring
But it is a TD. Game. Instant classic. Wow
That will be reviewed.
Unreal. Ball at the 1
When someone can place a throw in these tight windows like Brady is now doing nothing a defense can do
It has been a tough year for @NFL but you could not ask for a better #Super Bowl to close it out.
Bad knee injury. Hyperextended. Tough to see
No reason not to sell out on the block here
Tough spot for Matt Ryan. They should really let clock run here. Turnover here or blocked punt and you give them shot at a 3
Atlanta you now know what this Brady guy has done to me and my Dolphins for 15 years.
This game has completely turned since the Gaga show.
This new KFC Colonel in commercials is freaky scary.
If Patriots win this game you will see that catch for years to come. Inches off ground.
That is the helmet catch of this #super bowl
Falcons are mauling this receivers. They aren't going to call holding on every play
Just over 3 minutes and perhaps the best QB in NFL history is a touchdown and a 2 away from incredible comeback
Atlanta need to play to punt here try to pin inside 10
There are maybe two people in league today who can make that catch
This could be a career defining drive for Matt Ryan
The 8 points from pick six and missed extra point is now the difference in the game.
And the quick score less than 2 minutes on the drive
And there is the turnover
If Falcons get 1st down here with 9 minutes left Patriots have at most two full possessions left unless they get a turnover or quick score
Worse thing about #SuperBowl blowouts? Everyone leaves early &amp; you become sole member of the cleanup crew.
Knew Falcons could score but had no idea their defense this fast &amp; disruptive.don't watch NFC much AFCdid they play D like this all year?
That was a sack of Brady with evil intentions
When it rains.......
Need to look for Bennett here
cant run and dropping passes very UN-patriot like Credit to Atlanta D Playing aggressive man &amp; willing to take a few holding calls downfield
Because Dolphins have played him twice a year for 15 years I have seen this movie before. Brady is very good in these situations.
Very big 3rd down
opening drive of 2nd half of this #SuperBowl is big. If @AtlantaFalcons put up another 7 will be quite a statement &amp; may be fatal dagger
Wasn't sure what to expect with everything going on. But that was quite a show by @ladyGaga one of best #SuperBowl  shows I can remember
When you are down 18 the longer than usual halftime of a #SuperBowl is a bit of a break.A little longer to make adjustments &amp; break momentum
This is where they miss Gronk. Inside the 20
Wow! Pick Six.
No quarterback not even the great Tom Brady is going to do well with being roughed up on virtually every pass play.
I hadn't seen many @AtlantaFalcons all year. The speed of their defense at the second and third level is impressive.
Liberty City own @devontafreeman makes his mark on first play from scrimmage
President George H.W. Bush such a honorable and decent man. Wonderful moment at #SuperBowl
Congratulations @JasonTaylor elected @NFL HOF.Great player I had privilege to watch since day 1 with @MiamiDolphins

Another strong day by our Ambassador to the #UnitedNations @nikkihaley as she condemns Putin aggression against #Urkaine 
Radical left wing extremists are now in control of many Senate Democrats. And they have been ordered to block everything or else. 
Good to see Trump admin put #Iran on notice.  Why we need new sanctions on missiles. 
Many Democratic colleagues tell me they have heavy pressure from left wing radicals to oppose everything even before they know what it is
Role of #SCOTUS member is to apply the Constitution not to change it or substitute it with their own political views.
#GorsuchNomination by @POTUS best pick since Reagan.High intellectreasonablefederalist. Imagine what pick would be if Clinton had won!

Under #FidelCastro Cuba represses nearly all forms of political dissent” the independent group Human Rights Watch observed in 2008.
When #FidelCastro ships spotted tugboat full of refugees on July 1994 blasted it to pieces with high-pressure fire hoses. 41 refugees died
Well into the 1970s #FidelCasto was imprisoning gays and long-haired young people in work camps.Read more here: 
"#FidelCastro ""created repressive state where his secret police &amp; pro-government mobs attacked those who dared to call for democratic change"""
"""a ruthless dictator..executed thousands of opponents imprisoned tens of thousands.."": "
Today let's remember how #FidelCastro used MIG-29 combat pilots to kill unarmed civilians #Brotherstotherescue back in 1996. #cuba
"So called ""Journalists"" hail  #FidelCastro’s Achievements ‘George Washington’ ‘Folk Hero to Most of Us’ "
History will remember Fidel Castro as an evil murderous dictator who inflicted misery &amp; suffering on his own people

Since Obama paid ransom to #Iran at least two more Americans taken hostage.

BTW that doesnt excuse congress.People in BOTH parties have played games with #Zika.Should go back to DC &amp; pass bipartisan Senate bill asap.

If that is conclusion you reached I respect that. But after 8 years of Obama 4 yrs of Clinton is too much for me. 
Then that is why we need some different voices at convention and beyond. 
Attack Republicans? Who? 
That was a special night.  
I respect and understand it. 
"Nerd. JK It's my first day on job as a ""keyboard cowboy""cut me some slack "
How do we repeal Obamacare with POTUS signature?

@rightwinglatina not unusual to have speakers at convention who have real policy differences with nominee. 2/2
@rightwinglatina thank you.As for convention if I gave speech it would be speech that reflected MY policy views which have NOT changed. 1/2
@BillKristol @philipaklein I &amp; respect your position.The choice before us is far from ideal.Everyone will have to make own choice
If you can live with a Clinton presidency for 4 years thats your right. I cant and will do what I can to prevent it.
In Florida only 2 legitimate candidates on ballot in Nov. I wont vote for Clinton &amp; I after years of asking people to vote I wont abstain.
"Funny piece by @philipaklein. Easy to be a ""keyboard cowboy"".I actually ran &amp; spent year away from home trying to prevent choice before us"

According to source who knows his cousins wife's dentist Rubio could do cardio instead.

"A source ""close to Rubio"" says he was tired after long day &amp; has decided to sleep for a few hours before tomorrow's ZIKA debate in Senate."
As for future in politics well it's nearly impossible for someone not in office to ever become a successful candidate for President.Right?

@TodaysHow didn't focus on the real story here HUD projects runs by slumlords who pocket money but do no maintenance. #EurekaGardens

@EWErickson: EXCLUSIVE: Marco Rubio’s New Video Focuses on His Conservatism 
Iran knows they can get away with anything -- including humiliating our sailors -- as long as Obama is in office. 
ISIS must be confronted for what they are: a growing and looming threat. 
The U.S. sailors were taken by Iran because President Obama is weak.
@ShaneAGOP: Just another Wednesday afternoon phone bank here at Team @marcorubio NH HQ! #NHforMarco #nhpolitics #Marcomentum 
Nobody is above the law not even Hillary Clinton. 
Believe it or not multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people. 
A great crowd at our rally in Mt. Pleasant SC today! Thanks for the warm welcome. 
This president has always underestimated the threat of ISIS. 
The reason Hillary Clinton is attacking me this time is absurd: 
Obamacare must be repealed and replaced. It's hurting Americans all over our country:  
Iran held and humiliated our sailors -- knowing they can get away with anything as long as Obama is in office.

No job creator wants more taxes or regulations yet that's exactly what some candidates for president are proposing.

This letter from a voter is a reminder of how important 2016 is: we must elect someone who will repeal Obamacare. 
Our nationwide network of conservatives keeps growing.

@TeamMarco: This conservative leader in Iowa says it perfectly:  
America needs a real commander-in-chief and a president who will keep us safe. 
I was asked today how I would deal with North Korea. Here are four things I would do to stop them:
Obama's gun control executive order undermines the 2nd amendment and will do nothing to keep people safe. 
The number one priority as president is to keep our country safe. 
to people like Kim Jong-un and ensure our country has the capabilities necessary to keep America safe. (5/5)
Our enemies around the world are taking advantage of Obama's weakness. We need new leadership that will stand up (4/5)
If this test is confirmed it will be just the latest example of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policy. (3/5)
who has been expanding his nuclear arsenal while President Obama has stood idly by. (2/5)

Enter to win a trip for 2 to watch the first debate of 2016 LIVE in person:
Watch my new TV ad that begins airing today: 
President Obama is obsessed with undermining the 2nd Amendment.  
America needs a real commander-in-chief and a president who will keep us safe.

The Iran deal has already become nothing more than a get-out-of-jail-free card.
