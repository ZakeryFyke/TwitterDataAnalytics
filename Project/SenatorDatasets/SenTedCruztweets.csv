Tomorrow is the final day Cambodian citizens can register to vote in 2018 elections. Hun Sen must take the first step toward reestablishing democratic credibility by freeing Kem Sokha. If he does not then in return I'll work to ban responsible officials from traveling to the US. 
This attempt from the Cambodian government to assuage the United States is deeply concerning. 
I commend @RepDeSantis for @gopoversight hearing on the importance of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital &amp; moving the US embassy there. 
This National Day for Victims of Communism we honor the memory of millions who have died &amp; the plights of those who still suffer under totalitarian regimes. 
Happy Birthday Rev. @BillyGraham! Your remarkable ministry has uplifted millions &amp; inspired entire generations.
Senate should repeal #Obamacare’s individual mandate in tax reform bill keeping more money in #Americans’ pockets-&gt; 
@SteveDaines: .@SenTedCruz is right — we need to repeal the individual mandate. It is a fine on the poor in our country. 
In case you missed my interview with @ShannonBream on @foxnewsnight last night watch it here -&gt; 
Tax cuts are critical and I believe we can get it done. 
There is a path forward to true tax cuts in repealing Obamacare. Tax payers are losing exemptions &amp; paying higher taxes- that is a mistake. 
The main focus of these tax cuts should be on jobs jobs jobs and more jobs for all #Americans. 
@sendavidperdue: .@SenTedCruz is right: changing the tax code is about creating more opportunity for American workers and families. 
We must fulfill our promises made to the #American people &amp; provide true tax cuts for all.

#TalkingTax w @taxfoundation: When it comes to #TaxReform simplicity has power. Bold simplicity has enormous power. 
.@taxfoundation: We need fairness across the country btwn big &amp; little companies. It needs to benefit everyone to lift after-tax incomes. 
“Dodd-Frank’s one of the most damaging pieces of legislation in modern times. The big banks are bigger &amp; smaller banks have been devastated” 
"""To sum up five imperative items for #TaxReform: Growth. Postcard. Full expensing. Tax cuts. And repeal Dodd-Frank."" With @taxfoundation "
#TalkingTax with @taxfoundation: #AbolishTheIRS

@taxfoundation: .@tedcruz: Full expensing is one of the most powerful ways to grow the economy and boost middle-class wages. #TalkingTax…
"""When enacting tax reform we must repeal DoddFrank. It only benefits the giant financial institutions-but what about smaller banks?"" "
"""Americans shouldn't be subject to parallel &amp; duplicative tax systems. Tax reform gives the opportunity to end the alternative minimum tax."" "
#TalkingTax: #TaxReform will not be efficient until we end the death tax. 
#TalkingTax: Lowering tax rates will also help encourage repatriation bringing #American businesses back to the #US. 
"""Corporate tax rates need to be lowered; resulting in businesses paying less in taxes &amp; creating additional jobs."" With @taxfoundation "
#TalkingTax: Let's make it simple. Filing taxes on a postcard will save #Americans time &amp; lots of money. 
#TaxReform must include a low flat tax rate. Everyone should pay the same low rate for a fairer tax code. 
.@taxfoundation: In order to accomplish substantial tax relief we must focus on seven  pivotal priorities to benefit all #Americans. 
#TalkingTax: #America needs fundamental #TaxReform to encourage economic expansion &amp; further employment opportunities to #smallbiz owners. 
Live now! #TalkingTax with @TaxFoundation watch here:

Spoke about my thoughts about last night’s #Senate vote hope you’ll watch! 
Thoughts &amp; prayers w/ victims &amp; families of attack in Hamburg. We must crush radical Islamic terrorism. 
Fixing the train wreck of #Obamacare will not be easy but I believe in time this Congress will honor our promises 
Rest in peace Charlie. You will not be forgotten. May God surround the Gards with love as we lift them up in prayer.

As we move forward in the debate process I will continue advocating for the #ConsumerFreedom Amendment. 
CRUZ:If the democrats do not like your insurance plan then you cannot keep it..#ConsumerFreedom amendment does not take away a single choice 
CRUZ: If we are lowering premiums...that is a win for everyone...for conservatives for moderates...that should be a win for democrats 
CRUZ: My #ConsumerFreedom amendment says you should choose what meets the needs for you + your family. 
CRUZ:The harms from #Obamamcare have been mounting for 7 years + now after years of stonewalling the D's now claim they want to do something 
WATCH NOW: Live on @SenateFloor talking about my #ConsumerFreedom amendment during tonight's #healthcare debate 
Today's vote on MTP was a critical step in the right direction in order for Congress to provide relief from the harms of #Obamacare

This issue should unite Republicans &amp; Democrats: The widow of a Nobel Peace laureate should not be kept hostage in Communist China.
As we grieve his loss our focus must be his widow Liu Xia. I will continue my effort to honor Liu Xiaobo and to secure Liu Xia’s livelihood
Dr. Liu’s challenge against the immoral Communist system of political oppression reverberates today more than ever
Today the world lost a hero of liberty and freedom: Dr. Liu Xiaobo 
#QueElPuebloDecida #UnMundoSinMordaza 
@ConcernedVets: 
In the absence of assurance and the waning of time this body must act. And it must act now.  #FreeLiuXiaobo #FreeLiuXia
The end goal has never been to merely rename a street but rather to shine light on the Liu’s and pressure the PRC to do the right thing.
I have come to this floor on 3 separate occasions for unanimous consent to rename the street in front of the Chinese embassy after Dr. Liu
Only one man stands between a dying man’s wish and his wife’s livelihood and freedom: Xi Jinping. #FreeLiuXiaobo #FreeLiuXia
Today eight years into his unjust imprisonment Dr. Liu needs our help more than ever. #FreeLiuXiaobo #FreeLiuXia
It is impossible to neglect this stark irony: a man dedicated to non-violence imprisoned for promoting peace. #FreeLiuXiaobo #FreeLiuXia
For his work in ‘Charter 08’ a manifesto shining light on the Communist Party he received a Nobel Peace Prize and an 11-yr prison sentence
Dr. Liu and his wife are the faces of liberty in China. For that they've been detained imprisoned and abused. #FreeLiuXiaobo #FreeLiuXia

I have every confidence that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court. @senjudiciary 
@FreeBeacon: .@SenTedCruz Points Out Democrats’ Prior Support Of Gorsuch  
Justice Scalia reminded us that words matter. The judge's job is to follow the words that are in the law not replace with those that aren't 
"Dems accuse Gorsuch of not looking out for ""the little guy” - while they spent 8 yrs attacking Little Sisters of the Poor for relig beliefs "
A decade ago Judge Gorsuch was confirmed in the Senate. Not a single Democrat spoke a word of opposition. #ConfirmGorsuch @senjudiciary 
Scalia was one of the greatest #SCOTUS justices a trailblazing advocate for the #Constitution's original meaning 
Neil Gorsuch recognizes the pivotal role the judiciary plays in defending liberties recognized in the #BillofRights 
I have every confidence that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court. 
To my Dem colleagues what has changed? 10yrs ago he was so unobjectionable that he didnt merit a word of disapproval 
A decade ago Judge Gorsuch was confirmed in the Senate. Not one Democrat spoke in opposition to him. #SCOTUS 
His record demonstrates a faithful commitment to the #Constitution and the #RuleofLaw. 
Like the renowned justice he is set to replace Judge Gorsuch is brilliant and immensely talented. #SCOTUS 
For conservatives we know the opposite to be true. Judges are not supposed to make law they faithfully apply it. 
There is sharp disagreement about the very nature of #SCOTUS. Some view it as a hyper-powerful political branch...
