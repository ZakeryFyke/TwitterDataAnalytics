@SenSchumer: We cannot banish evil or madness frm the earth. But Congress &amp; @POTUS must do all in our power to make our country a safer‚Ä¶
Amidst an abundance of grief: keep going; keep helping; keep comforting; keep loving; and by all means keep demanding justice.
We are not powerless against such evil. We must take common sense widely supported steps to reduce such violence agony and grievous loss.
It is not enough to ask how could someone do this. We must also ask ourselves how can I prevent something like this from happening again.
‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people should do nothing.‚Äù
My soul aches over Las Vegas. My prayers are with the victims. And my prayers are with our nation may we resolve to do more stop such evil.

Transgender Americans in military are heroes like anyone else risking their lives to defend us. @POTUS is wrong: 
You can still reach out to others in Congress. Also: Get Folk Woke.  Advocate to others in other districts and states to fight too. 
Thank you for listening and for being a part of the resistance to this legislation. 
If such a bill passes the mortality rate in our country will rise. We must kill this bill and save the lives of our fellow  Americans. 
When my father died and I was swallowed by grief New Jersey Dems &amp; Repus reached out to me. I love all my state not just those in my party. 
Thank you but today was a grave &amp; awful day. The clock is now ticking. We must all take responsibility to stop this craven Republican bill. 
Kindness isn't weakness or lack of conviction. Kindness doesn't weaken an argument. U don't need to be mean or cruel to be strong or tough. 
I love you too. And I try to live up to my ideals of also loving my enemy. 
I too am engulfed with anger. But I will never let them rob me of my decency. You either submit to the darkness or fight it with light. 
And you too need a hug. We should all show kindness &amp; decency to one another even when our disagreements couldn't be greater. #IHuggedMcCain 
We all must continue the fight in these hours before the vote. Let your voice be heard. 
Thank you for fighting for us. We are all in this together. We must defeat this craven bill.

@asberry_amanda There can be. But Republicans have to let Dems at the table to start conversations. Now they are doing healthcare behind closed doors.

I was so grateful to do the @PodSaveAmerica interview. Thanks for your feedback. 
I have concerns about corporate consolidation in general but I love my local Newark Whole Foods store and believe it will only get better. 
Such a strong documentary. 
I honor your speech rights but you don't get to name me. May we both draw pride in our roots &amp; honor them through our service to others. 
@sjmorris31 @KillerVegan I've got to get there to try it.
"@AltLeft2017 U are wrong on so many points: I do support Medicare for all &amp; why don't you read the entire article about ""pause"" : "
@kerri_blanchard Kerry Kushners were a major Dem family years ago that supported many Dem candidates. Dems contributions ended years before Trump presidency
Thank you for this point. And there are other urgent health related issues that we need to keep focused on like environmental toxins. 
Kerri you seem confused about me. But I sincerely wish you well and appreciate your advocacy particularly for environmental justice. 
You are so right. Many folks don't understand how our broken food systems and food deserts undermine American health. 
@NaomiYoungstein @0619b0f3ff9b4f8 Thanks for telling the truth Naomi.
Yes. 
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks for being open to the truth.
The Whole Foods at lunch is now a happening place in Newark. Many vegan/vegetarian options. 
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks Ellen. And please read this too: 
@chiweethedog Sorry u believe the many Dems who received contributions years ago from a major Dem family (years before they became Repub) is wrong.
@robinAKAroblimo Hope you will read this whole article: 
@robinAKAroblimo 
Love @KillerVegan. Everyone also raves about their Sunday brunch but I haven't tried it yet. 
We do. A major part of Obamacare is about prevention as well as early detection and diagnosis.

They most certainly do. 
@techs4good Thank you!
@Dr_Zil_White Thank you.
I agree and will work to this end. 
There are many vegan/vegetarian friendly spots in Newark. I invite my followers to share their favorites with you.

We've lost our outrage. We hyper incarcerate the poor sick &amp; minorities at grievous cost &amp; fail to invest in reentry education &amp; treatment 
Since failed war on drugs Fed govt has reduced investment in local police by more than 75% and increased in prisons almost 50%. Madness! 
We can do both. Why pour $$ into failed criminal justice policies?! Redirect to victims assistance &amp; more police and police accountability.

Thanks. So good to be here tonight. 
May we remember folk in prison are still part of our society; we are defined by how we treat them and how we offer them hope for redemption.
From the warden to the incarcerated women who advocated for issues of no direct benefit to them today I saw the power of tireless love.
Again I am grateful for those - especially at today's prison - who pour their heart into their work and affirm human dignity.
America is paying too high a price for a broken criminal justice system that harms too much &amp; helps too little. We must all demand better.
Women face unique challenges in prison. Thanks to insights from the warden staff &amp; women I listened to I'll step up my fight for reform.
We must also do a better job focusing on the reality that so many of the people we incarcerate especially women are survivors of traumas.
Our criminal justice system is broken you see it up close visiting prisons; from excessive sentencing to lack of resources for reentry.
I'm grateful to the professionals who work there - corrections officers medical staff &amp; more - who do hard &amp; difficult work for our nation.
Just finished a visit to another Federal Prison. I visited for many reasons including to learn more about issues facing incarcerated women.

@MonicaJORourke @KaivanShroff So sad you believe that taking money from a NJ Dem family years before Trump ascended makes you lose faith. Pretty much every dem in NJ did.

@EnebongEphraim @bvezos I've spent months attacking this adminstration for their ills. Anyone can pull the multiple videos on this.
@bvezos You are a good person and righteous soul. Clearly you didn't listen to my interview or follow my activism against this administration.
@anapazprado You clearly didn't actually listen to my interciew and are wildly mistaken about my work against this Adminstration.
@Pena_Law You are a good &amp; righteous activist. It is sad  if you actually believe what u just wrote. Clearly u know nothing about me or my life work

Today isn't an end of US leadership on global climate issues; instead it is a rallying cry for us to double down in this urgent fight.
I reject President Trump's wanting climate leadership and will not yield in the fight against his dangerous environmental policy.
In a few days from his G7 meetings to his Rose Garden speech Trump has moved us from a position of global leadership to reckless isolation
Trump is wrong: It's not economy vs environment or America vs the world. It's future vs past; progress &amp; opportunity vs retreat &amp; surrender.
Pres Trump's Decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a vicious blow to American leadership in the world and to our future.

Soon. Senator Franken @alfranken has sincerely written a masterpiece. And he isn't shy about letting you know that either. 
I worried about the same thing. But there are so many good ones out there that pull me in. Try it. 
Probably not. But I just got an early copy of Al Franken's book. Devoured it. It is hilarious honest heartfelt and inspiring. 
Not much anymore. But my early years were sourced by everyone from Kurt Vonnegut to James Baldwin. Pick up Welcome To The Monkey House. 
Thanks Herb. I will check it out.

GOP's so-called health care bill gives tax breaks to insurance execs making millions but will charge you for a lapse in coverage...

Serious opioids &amp; other powerful drugs prescribed by doctors now. Yet u worry about marijuana!? This is a vital drug for many suffering ppl.

If you believe the lie that the ACA or Obamacare was rushed or forced down Repubs/Americans throats a reminder:  
I think it's s more than that there are those that perilously believe the free market will solve our nation's health care crisis. #Wrong 
Charles what does pot policy have to do with this? Unless u think fed government should finally allow Med marijuana. I'm that case I agree! 
Watch Paul Ryan's fail to defend Republican healthcare plan as @TuckerCarlson calls it out for benefiting wealthy: 
I believe we can &amp; must do both. For example we can condemn cruelty without being cruel we can fight bad policies without demeaning people.

Sorry don't buy that Republican lie. The ACA had dozens of hearings Obama had public dialogues with repub legislators a year long process 
"Quality healthcare isn't a ""burdensome tax"" it is an essential element of societal success like public education and access to clean water. "
There is a twisted cruelty to assert we can be a great nation if we only allows access to quality health care to the wealthy &amp; privileged. 
Denying access to preventive care mental healthcare prenatal care etc is WAY more expensive for society than universal access/coverage.

@SenBookerOffice: Congressional Republicans must recognize this fully exercise their oversight responsibilities and demand an independ‚Ä¶
@SenBookerOffice: There should be an independent investigation into Jeff Sessions‚Äô actions as well
@SenBookerOffice: Moreover there must be a thorough and independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election.
@SenBookerOffice: For the good of the country Jeff Sessions must resign as Attorney General.
@JuddLegum: This video documenting Trump's double talk on his relationship with Putin is well worth your time (via @BraddJaffy) 
This is the key question: 
@CAPAction: Here's the video of Sessions denying **under oath** that he had communications with the Russians. 
@carolelee: US officials have investigated Jeff Sessions contacts w Russian officials while he was advising the Trump campaign 
There are many legitimate reasons. Sessions should have disclosed it but didn't. Why? He is compromised. Independent investigation now. 
"No. Read his testimony. He's ""explaining"" now. But if what he says is true why not disclose that to the committee? Why hide it? "
He has responded but for the integrity of the investigation he should recuse himself AND join our call for an independent special council. 
Thank you for engaging with me on this platform and for your kind feedback. 
It wasn't a change. I've always supported imports. Happy we have a strong bill that addresses legitimate safety concerns. 
I and other Senate colleagues have been quick to call this out. We will continue to lead in the fight for independent investigations. 
Thanks. The film is on Netflix and I have been getting a lot of feedback on the documentary on my 1st campaign of recent. Thanks 4 your work 
There has been much upsetting of recent. But we must take care of ourselves and each other. There is hard work and challenging days ahead. 
Thank you. I'm proud of my testimony against Sessions and it is kind of you to say it inspired you. Thank you. 
At the very least his testimony was (intentionally or not) misleading. His ability to independently investigate is irreversibly compromised. 
Sessions testified that he had no contact with Russian officials. We now know he did. We can not rely on him for an objective investigation. 
The revaluation is deeply disturbing. Sessions should never have been confirmed. Now as before we must have an independent investigation. 
It is sacred civic space. So much about it I am in awe of. But quirky? There is the candy drawer that is both curious and quirky. 
Christos sincerely representing our state is the greatest honor of my life. I so love Jersey. 
Peanut Butter Patties. They are vegan and delicious. 
The candy is so Jersey! They were invented in Newark in the 1940s. One of the best candies ever (but I no longer eat them as I'm now vegan). 
Are you talking about the mode of transportation or @SenSchumer's hoagie? Well actually the answer is yes in both cases. 
I've not only said it but I've introduced legislation (with GOP cosponsors) to do that and more regarding marijuana. 
I'm proud of my many bipartisan bills. It's 1 of best ways I can serve NJ. But when POTUS uses his power to hurt NJ residents I will fight. 
Amen. Let's all work to find common ground. But when people violate our collective values I believe we must stand our ground and resist. 
We all need to heed your advice no matter what our position. 
You are one of my constituents. Please step away from twitter. Get some sleep. I believe in you! 
No. It wasn't a bill. What I did do though is join him in authoring actual legislation allowing imports with strong safety provisions. 
Yes you can. 
I can't sleep Richie and I figured it would be good to have an impromptu twitter town hall. 
No. But I welcome you here in Jersey with open arms. #EmbraceTheGardenState 
I signed up for this and am grateful for the twitter community who follows me. Thanks Karen. 
Love you too. 
Your meme is PAWsome. 
I will be relentless in this fight. It is one reason I opposed Jeff Sessions &amp; also why I cosponsored reform legislation with GOP Senators. 
"As one of my heroes Bryan Stevenson says ""We're a nation that often treats u better if you're rich &amp; guilty than if you're poor &amp; innocent"" "

@NeverCorporate So I went to work with Sen Sanders and Casey to write ACTUAL import legislation with strong safety provisions.
@NeverCorporate Sorry you believe that. The nonbonding resolution I voted against had little in terms of safety.

It was a team effort and I am so grateful to @rasbaraka's leadership and that of his administration for getting this across the finish line.

@Shayamborghini @MarcoRLamas And take a look at this too: 
@Shayamborghini @MarcoRLamas Finally I hope you will read the actual legislation:  ‚Ä¶
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 4. Our legislation now includes very strong safety provisions.
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 3. I then went right to work with Sen Sanders and Casey to write ACTUAL LEGISLATION that would allow imports.
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini 2. I voted against it as I said then because it didn't contain strong safety provisions. . .
@MarcoRLamas @Shayamborghini You're wrong! I'm answering. 1. I didnt vote against cheap meds. It was a nonbonding resolution NOT legislation
@FairlyfocusedOp I constantly attack the 2nd amendment. You must have me confused with someone else.

@veritasingod 2. I then worked with others to write ACTUAL legislation with Sanders and Casey that allows imports with strong safety...
@veritasingod Sure: 1. I didn't vote against legislation just a nonbonding resolution that didn't have adequate safety language...
Thank you for the kind encouragement. May we all stand up for what is right and let our voices be heard.
